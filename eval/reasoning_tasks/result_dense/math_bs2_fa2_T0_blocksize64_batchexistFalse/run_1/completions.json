["Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to convert the rectangular coordinates (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, \u03b8), where r is the distance from the origin and \u03b8 is the angle made with the positive x-axis. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas, so let me think.\n\nFirst, I recall that to convert from rectangular (x, y) to polar (r, \u03b8), there are some standard formulas. I think r is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, so r equals the square root of (x squared plus y squared). Yeah, that makes sense because it's like finding the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by x and y. So, for the point (0, 3), x is 0 and y is 3. Plugging that in, r would be sqrt(0^2 + 3^2) which is sqrt(9), so r is 3. Okay, that part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, for \u03b8, the angle. I remember that \u03b8 is calculated using the arctangent function, specifically arctangent of y over x. The formula is \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But wait, in this case, x is 0. If I plug in x as 0, I get arctan(3/0). Hmm, dividing by zero is undefined. So, I need to think about what angle \u03b8 would correspond to a point where x is 0 and y is positive.\n\nIn the rectangular coordinate system, when x is 0, the point lies on the y-axis. Since y is positive, it's on the positive y-axis. In polar coordinates, the positive y-axis corresponds to an angle of \u03c0/2 radians, right? Because 0 radians is along the positive x-axis, \u03c0/2 is straight up along the positive y-axis, \u03c0 is along the negative x-axis, and so on.\n\nLet me verify that. If \u03b8 is \u03c0/2, then the point in rectangular coordinates would be (r*cos(\u03b8), r*sin(\u03b8)). Plugging in r = 3 and \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, we get (3*cos(\u03c0/2), 3*sin(\u03c0/2)). Cos(\u03c0/2) is 0 and sin(\u03c0/2) is 1, so that gives (0, 3), which is exactly the point we started with. So that checks out.\n\nBut just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me think about other quadrants. If x were positive and y were positive, \u03b8 would be in the first quadrant, which is between 0 and \u03c0/2. If x were negative and y positive, \u03b8 would be in the second quadrant, between \u03c0/2 and \u03c0. But in our case, x is 0, so it's exactly on the y-axis, not in a quadrant. So, it's either \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2. But since y is positive, it has to be \u03c0/2, not 3\u03c0/2, because 3\u03c0/2 is pointing downward along the negative y-axis.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the signs of x and y to determine the quadrant. Since x is 0, it doesn't help, but y is positive, so it's either the positive y-axis or negative y-axis. Since it's positive, it's \u03c0/2. If it were negative, it would be 3\u03c0/2.\n\nWait, just to confirm, if we had the point (0, -3), \u03b8 would be 3\u03c0/2. Let me check that. Using the same conversion, r would still be 3, and \u03b8 would be arctan(-3/0). Again, division by zero, but since y is negative, it's pointing downward, which is 3\u03c0/2. So, yeah, that logic holds.\n\nSo, in our original problem, since y is positive, \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2). I think that's the answer.\n\nBut let me think again about the formula for \u03b8. Sometimes, depending on the calculator or the method used, arctangent can give different results if you're not careful with the signs. But in this case, since x is 0, it's straightforward because arctan(y/0) is undefined, but geometrically, we know it's either \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2, and since y is positive, it's \u03c0/2.\n\nIs there another way to compute \u03b8? Maybe using the cosine or sine directly? Let me see. Since we have r = 3, and the point is (0, 3). So, cosine of \u03b8 would be x/r, which is 0/3 = 0. So, cos(\u03b8) = 0. What angle \u03b8 has cosine equal to 0? That's \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 and \u03b8 = 3\u03c0/2. Then, sine of \u03b8 would be y/r, which is 3/3 = 1. So, sin(\u03b8) = 1. What angle \u03b8 has sine equal to 1? That's \u03b8 = \u03c0/2. So, combining both, cos(\u03b8) = 0 and sin(\u03b8) = 1, \u03b8 must be \u03c0/2. That's another way to think about it, using both sine and cosine.\n\nAlternatively, if I use the two-argument arctangent function, which is sometimes denoted as arctan2(y, x), which takes into account the signs of both y and x to determine the correct quadrant. In this case, x is 0 and y is positive, so arctan2(3, 0) would return \u03c0/2. If x were 0 and y were negative, it would return -\u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2 depending on the convention, but in our case, it's \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, all these methods point to \u03b8 being \u03c0/2. So, I feel confident that the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2). Let me just write that down.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polar coordinates are \\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the rectangular coordinates \\((0, 3)\\) to polar coordinates \\((r, \\theta)\\):\n\n1. Calculate \\(r\\) using the formula \\(r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n   \\]\n\n2.

Since \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = 3\\) (positive), the angle \\(\\theta\\) is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the polar coordinates are \\(\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}\\).", "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>Define\n\\[p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}.\\]Find a way to write\n\\[\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\]in terms of $p$ and $q.$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to find a way to express the double sum \\(\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\) in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), where \\(p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}\\) and \\(q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}\\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that \\(p\\) is the well-known Basel problem, which sums to \\(\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\), and \\(q\\) is the Riemann zeta function at 3, which doesn't have a simple expression in terms of elementary functions but is known to be approximately 1.2020569...\n\nBut I don't think I need the exact numerical values; instead, I need to express the double sum in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). So, maybe I can manipulate the double sum to relate it to \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\nLet me write out the double sum:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\n\\]\n\nI notice that the denominator is \\((j + k)^3\\), which reminds me of the terms in \\(q\\), but instead of just \\(k\\), it's the sum \\(j + k\\). Maybe I can change variables to make this more manageable.\n\nLet me consider substituting \\(n = j + k\\). If I fix \\(n\\), then \\(j\\) can range from 1 to \\(n - 1\\), because \\(k\\) has to be at least 1 as well. So, for each \\(n \\geq 2\\), the number of pairs \\((j, k)\\) such that \\(j + k = n\\) is \\(n - 1\\). Therefore, the double sum can be rewritten as a single sum over \\(n\\) from 2 to infinity, where each term is \\(\\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\\).\n\nSo, let's write that:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the numerator:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3}\\right)\n\\]\n\nThat's because \\(\\frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3}\\). So now, the sum becomes the difference of two sums:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nBut I know that \\(p = \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}\\) and \\(q = \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}\\). So, if I subtract the \\(n=1\\) terms from both sums, I can express \\(S\\) in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\nLet's compute the first sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} = p - \\frac{1}{1^2} = p - 1\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} = q - \\frac{1}{1^3} = q - 1\n\\]\n\nTherefore, substituting back into \\(S\\):\n\n\\[\nS = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q\n\\]\n\nWait, let me verify that step. So, \\((p - 1) - (q - 1)\\) simplifies to \\(p - 1 - q + 1\\), which indeed is \\(p - q\\). That seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check my substitution. I had \\(S = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty (\\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3})\\), which is equal to \\(\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}\\). Since \\(p = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}\\), subtracting the \\(n=1\\) term gives \\(p - 1\\). Similarly, \\(q - 1\\) for the other sum. So, subtracting those gives \\(p - 1 - (q - 1) = p - q\\). That seems right.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me compute a few terms manually to see if this makes sense.\n\nFor \\(j=1, k=1\\): \\(\\frac{1}{(1+1)^3} = \\frac{1}{8}\\)\n\nFor \\(j=1, k=2\\): \\(\\frac{1}{(1+2)^3} = \\frac{1}{27}\\)\n\nFor \\(j=2, k=1\\): \\(\\frac{1}{(2+1)^3} = \\frac{1}{27}\\)\n\nFor \\(j=1, k=3\\): \\(\\frac{1}{64}\\), and so on.\n\nSo, if I group terms by \\(n = j + k\\):\n\n- \\(n=2\\): only (1,1): \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\)\n- \\(n=3\\): (1,2) and (2,1): \\(\\frac{1}{27} + \\frac{1}{27} = \\frac{2}{27}\\)\n- \\(n=4\\): (1,3), (2,2), (3,1): \\(\\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{3}{64}\\)\n- And so on.\n\nSo, the sum \\(S\\) can be written as:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nWhich is exactly what I had before. Therefore, the expression \\(p - q\\) should be the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be extra sure, let me compute the first few terms numerically and see if it aligns with \\(p - q\\).\n\nCompute the first few terms of \\(S\\):\n\n- \\(n=2\\): \\(1/8 = 0.125\\)\n- \\(n=3\\): \\(2/27 \\approx 0.074074\\)\n- \\(n=4\\): \\(3/64 \\approx 0.046875\\)\n- \\(n=5\\): \\(4/125 = 0.032\\)\n- \\(n=6\\): \\(5/216 \\approx 0.023148\\)\n- Adding these up: 0.125 + 0.074074 \u2248 0.199074; +0.046875 \u2248 0.245949; +0.032 \u2248 0.277949; +0.023148 \u2248 0.301097.\n\nNow, compute \\(p - q\\):\n\n\\(p = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n^2 \\approx 1.644934\\)\n\n\\(q = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n^3 \\approx 1.2020569\\)\n\nSo, \\(p - q \\approx 1.644934 - 1.2020569 \\approx 0.442877\\)\n\nWait, but my partial sum of \\(S\\) is only about 0.301 after 5 terms. Hmm, that suggests that maybe \\(p - q\\) is larger than \\(S\\), which contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.\n\nWait, let's compute \\(p - q\\):\n\n\\(p = 1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + 1/25 + 1/36 + \\dots\\)\n\n\\(q = 1 + 1/8 + 1/27 + 1/64 + 1/125 + 1/216 + \\dots\\)\n\nSo, \\(p - q = (1 - 1) + (1/4 - 1/8) + (1/9 - 1/27) + (1/16 - 1/64) + \\dots\\)\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\(0 + (1/8) + (2/27) + (3/64) + \\dots\\)\n\nWait a second! That's exactly the same as the double sum \\(S\\). So, term by term, \\(p - q\\) is equal to \\(S\\). So, when I compute \\(p - q\\), each term is the same as the grouped terms of \\(S\\). So, actually, my initial conclusion is correct, \\(S = p - q\\). So, why did my partial sum of \\(S\\) only give me about 0.301, while \\(p - q\\) is approximately 0.442877? Because \\(S\\) converges to that value, but I only summed the first five terms. Let me add more terms to see.\n\nCompute more terms for \\(S\\):\n\n- \\(n=7\\): \\(6/343 \\approx 0.01749\\)\n- \\(n=8\\): \\(7/512 \\approx 0.013672\\)\n- \\(n=9\\): \\(8/729 \\approx 0.010973\\)\n- \\(n=10\\): \\(9/1000 = 0.009\\)\n- Adding these: 0.301097 + 0.01749 \u2248 0.318587; +0.013672 \u2248 0.332259; +0.010973 \u2248 0.343232; +0.009 \u2248 0.352232.\n\nContinuing:\n\n- \\(n=11\\): \\(10/1331 \u2248 0.007514\\)\n- \\(n=12\\): \\(11/1728 \u2248 0.006369\\)\n- \\(n=13\\): \\(12/2197 \u2248 0.005472\\)\n- \\(n=14\\): \\(13/2744 \u2248 0.004738\\)\n- \\(n=15\\): \\(14/3375 \u2248 0.004151\\)\n- Adding these: 0.352232 + 0.007514 \u2248 0.359746; +0.006369 \u2248 0.366115; +0.005472 \u2248 0.371587; +0.004738 \u2248 0.376325; +0.004151 \u2248 0.380476.\n\nSo, after 15 terms, it's about 0.3805, which is still less than \\(p - q \u2248 0.442877\\). But of course, the series converges, and as we add more terms, it should approach that value. So, my initial conclusion that \\(S = p - q\\) seems correct.\n\nWait, but another thought: when I substituted \\(n = j + k\\), I had to consider all pairs \\((j, k)\\) such that \\(j, k \\geq 1\\). So, for each \\(n \\geq 2\\), there are \\(n - 1\\) such pairs, which gives the coefficient \\(n - 1\\) for each \\(1/n^3\\). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as a convolution of the sequence \\(1/k^3\\) with itself, but I think the substitution method is clearer here.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\n1. The double sum \\(S = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\).\n2. Change variables to \\(n = j + k\\).\n3. For each \\(n \\geq 2\\), there are \\(n - 1\\) pairs \\((j, k)\\).\n4. Therefore, \\(S = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\\).\n5. This can be split into two sums: \\(\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}\\).\n6. Each of these sums is just \\(p - 1\\) and \\(q - 1\\), respectively.\n7. Subtracting these gives \\(p - q\\).\n\nSo, yeah, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. The key insight was changing variables to \\(n = j + k\\), which transformed the double sum into a single sum that could be expressed in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\nJust to make sure, let me also think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using generating functions or integral representations?\n\nWell, considering generating functions, the double sum is similar to a convolution. Specifically, it's the convolution of the sequence \\(a_j = \\frac{1}{j^3}\\) with itself. In generating function terms, the generating function for \\(a_j\\) is \\(A(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^j}{j^3}\\), which is related to the polylogarithm function \\(\\text{Li}_3(x)\\).\n\nThe convolution of two sequences \\(a_j\\) and \\(b_k\\) is given by \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty c_n x^n\\), where \\(c_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n - 1} a_k b_{n - k}\\). In our case, both sequences are the same, so \\(c_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n - 1} \\frac{1}{k^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(n - k)^3}\\).\n\nWait, but in our problem, the double sum is \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\), which is similar but not exactly the same as the convolution. The convolution would be \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{j^3 k^3}\\), but our problem has \\(\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\).\n\nSo, actually, it's not a standard convolution. Therefore, maybe generating functions aren't the best approach here. My initial substitution seems more straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about integral representations. For example, since \\(\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\) can be expressed as an integral. But that might complicate things further. Probably not necessary since the substitution method worked.\n\nAnother thought: symmetry. Since the sum is over all \\(j\\) and \\(k\\), maybe we can relate it to known zeta function values or other known series.\n\nBut no, I think the substitution was the key step here. So, I think I'm confident that the double sum \\(S\\) is equal to \\(p - q\\).\n\nJust to confirm, let me compute \\(p - q\\) numerically:\n\n\\(p = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} \\approx 1.644934\\)\n\n\\(q = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} \\approx 1.2020569\\)\n\nSo, \\(p - q \\approx 1.644934 - 1.2020569 = 0.4428771\\)\n\nEarlier, after summing up to \\(n=15\\), I had \\(S \\approx 0.380476\\). Let me compute more terms to see if it approaches 0.442877.\n\nBut instead of computing term by term manually, maybe I can write a simple program or use a calculator. But since I don't have that luxury right now, I can estimate the tail of the series.\n\nThe tail of \\(S\\) after \\(n = 15\\) is \\(\\sum_{n=16}^\\infty \\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\\).\n\nWe can bound this tail. Notice that \\(\\frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3}\\), so the tail is \\(\\sum_{n=16}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\sum_{n=16}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}\\).\n\nWe know that \\(\\sum_{n=16}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} < \\int_{15}^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^2} dx = \\frac{1}{15} \\approx 0.0666667\\)\n\nSimilarly, \\(\\sum_{n=16}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} < \\int_{15}^\\infty \\frac{1}{x^3} dx = \\frac{1}{(15)^2} \\approx 0.0044444\\)\n\nTherefore, the tail is less than \\(0.0666667 - 0.0044444 = 0.0622223\\). So, the total sum \\(S\\) is less than \\(0.380476 + 0.0622223 \\approx 0.4426983\\), which is very close to \\(p - q \\approx 0.4428771\\). So, that gives me more confidence that my answer is correct.\n\nHence, after carefully considering different approaches and verifying the partial sums, I conclude that:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = p - q\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe double sum is equal to \\(p - q\\), so the answer is \\boxed{p - q}.\n</think>\n\nTo express the double sum \\(\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\) in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), where \\(p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}\\) and \\(q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}\\), we start by changing variables.\n\nLet \\(n = j + k\\).
