Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinates (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, \u03b8), where r is the distance from the origin and \u03b8 is the angle made with the positive x-axis. \n\nFirst, let me recall the formulas for converting from rectangular (x, y) to polar (r, \u03b8). I think the formula for r is the square root of (x squared plus y squared). Yeah, that sounds right. So, r = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). \n\nGiven the point is (0, 3), so x is 0 and y is 3. Let me plug those into the formula. So, r = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2). That simplifies to \u221a(0 + 9), which is \u221a9. So, r = 3. Okay, that seems straightforward.\n\nNow, for the angle \u03b8. I remember that \u03b8 is calculated using the arctangent function, specifically \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But wait, in this case, x is 0, so dividing by zero? Hmm, that might be a problem. Let me think about how to handle this.\n\nWhen x is 0, the point lies somewhere along the y-axis. If y is positive, then the point is on the positive y-axis, and if y is negative, it's on the negative y-axis. In our case, y is 3, which is positive, so the point is on the positive y-axis. \n\nI need to figure out what angle \u03b8 corresponds to the positive y-axis. I know that in the unit circle, 0 radians is along the positive x-axis, \u03c0/2 radians is along the positive y-axis, \u03c0 radians is along the negative x-axis, and so on. So, since our point is on the positive y-axis, \u03b8 should be \u03c0/2 radians.\n\nLet me verify that. If \u03b8 is \u03c0/2, then using the formula \u03b8 = arctan(y/x), but since x is 0, arctan(3/0) is arctan(inf), which is \u03c0/2. Yeah, that makes sense because as x approaches 0 from the positive side, arctan(y/x) approaches \u03c0/2. So, that seems correct.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake with the arctangent function. Sometimes, depending on the quadrant, the angle can be different, but in this case, since x is 0 and y is positive, it's definitely \u03c0/2. So, I think I'm good there.\n\nSo putting it all together, r is 3 and \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2). \n\nJust to double-check, if I convert back from polar to rectangular, using x = r cos \u03b8 and y = r sin \u03b8, I should get back to (0, 3). Let's see. \n\nx = 3 cos(\u03c0/2). Cos(\u03c0/2) is 0, so x = 3 * 0 = 0. \n\ny = 3 sin(\u03c0/2). Sin(\u03c0/2) is 1, so y = 3 * 1 = 3. \n\nYep, that gives me (0, 3), which matches the original point. So, that seems to confirm that my conversion is correct.\n\nI think that's all. I didn't run into any roadblocks except for the division by zero in the arctangent formula, but I remembered that when x is zero, the angle is either \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2 depending on the sign of y. Since y was positive here, it's \u03c0/2. \n\nSo, final answer should be (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polar coordinates are \\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the rectangular coordinates \\((0, 3)\\) to polar coordinates \\((r, \\theta)\\):\n\n1.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that \\(p\\) is the well-known Basel problem, which sums to \\(\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\), and \\(q\\) is the Riemann zeta function at 3, which doesn't have a simple closed-form expression but is known as Ap\u00e9ry's constant. But I don't think I need the exact values of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\); instead, I need to manipulate the given double sum to express it using \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\nLooking at the double sum \\(\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\), it's a double sum over positive integers \\(j\\) and \\(k\\), and the denominator is \\((j + k)^3\\). I wonder if I can change variables to simplify this expression. Maybe if I let \\(n = j + k\\), then for each \\(n\\), \\(j\\) can range from 1 to \\(n - 1\\), and \\(k = n - j\\). Let me try that.\n\nSo, if I set \\(n = j + k\\), then \\(j\\) goes from 1 to \\(n - 1\\), and \\(k\\) is determined as \\(k = n - j\\). Therefore, the original double sum can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^{n - 1} \\frac{1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nBecause for each \\(n\\), there are \\(n - 1\\) terms (since \\(j\\) starts at 1 and goes up to \\(n - 1\\)). So, simplifying the inner sum, since \\(\\frac{1}{n^3}\\) is constant with respect to \\(j\\), the inner sum is just \\(\\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\\). Therefore, the entire expression becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3} \\right )\n\\]\n\nSo, I can split this into two separate sums:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nNow, I can express these sums in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Let's handle the first sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} = \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{1^2} = p - 1\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} = \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} - \\frac{1}{1^3} = q - 1\n\\]\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q\n\\]\n\nWait, that simplifies to \\(p - q\\). So, does that mean the original double sum is equal to \\(p - q\\)? Let me double-check my steps.\n\n1. I changed variables from \\(j, k\\) to \\(n = j + k\\). For each \\(n \\geq 2\\), there are \\(n - 1\\) pairs \\((j, k)\\) such that \\(j + k = n\\).\n2. Then, the double sum becomes a single sum over \\(n\\) from 2 to infinity, with each term \\(\\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\\).\n3. Splitting this into two sums: \\(\\sum \\frac{1}{n^2}\\) and \\(\\sum \\frac{1}{n^3}\\), both starting from \\(n = 2\\).\n4. Subtracting the first term (when \\(n = 1\\)) from both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), which gives \\(p - 1\\) and \\(q - 1\\) respectively.\n5. Subtracting these two results: \\((p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q\\).\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach to verify.\n\nAnother way is to note that the double sum \\(\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\) can be interpreted as summing over all pairs \\((j, k)\\) where \\(j, k \\geq 1\\). If I fix \\(m = j + k\\), then for each \\(m \\geq 2\\), there are \\(m - 1\\) pairs. So, the sum becomes \\(\\sum_{m=2}^\\infty (m - 1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{m^3}\\), which is the same as I had before.\n\nSo, that seems consistent. Therefore, the sum simplifies to \\(p - q\\). Let me write that in LaTeX to make sure:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = p - q\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(p - q\\), which is \\(\\frac{\\pi^2}{6} - \\zeta(3)\\), but since the question asks for it in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), I just need to write \\(p - q\\).\n\nWait, hold on a second. Is there any chance that I made a mistake in the number of terms or in splitting the sum? Let me check with small values.\n\nFor example, when \\(n = 2\\), \\(j\\) can be 1, so one term: \\(\\frac{1}{2^3}\\).\n\nWhen \\(n = 3\\), \\(j\\) can be 1 or 2, so two terms: \\(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^3}\\).\n\nSimilarly, for \\(n = 4\\), three terms: \\(3 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4^3}\\), and so on.\n\nSo, indeed, for each \\(n\\), the number of terms is \\(n - 1\\), and the sum is \\(\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\\). So that part is correct.\n\nSplitting into \\(\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}\\) is also correct because \\(\\frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3}\\).\n\nThen, subtracting the \\(n=1\\) term from both \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) gives \\(p - 1\\) and \\(q - 1\\), so the difference is indeed \\(p - q\\). Okay, I think I'm confident that this is correct.\n\nTherefore, the double sum is equal to \\(p - q\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe double sum can be expressed as \\boxed{p - q}.\n</think>\n\nTo express the double sum \\(\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\) in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), where \\(p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}\\) and \\(q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}\\), we start by changing variables. Let \\(n = j + k\\), then for each \\(n \\geq 2\\), there are \\(n - 1\\) pairs \\((j, k)\\) such that \\(j + k = n\\). This transforms the double sum into:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^{n - 1} \\frac{1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nSince the inner sum is constant with respect to \\(j\\), it simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nThis can be split into two separate sums:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nExpressing these sums in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} = p - 1\n\\]\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} = q - 1\n\\]\n\nSubtracting these results gives:\n\n\\[\n(p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q\n\\]\n\nThus, the double sum can be expressed as:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{p - q}\n\\]"]
