["Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to convert the point (0, 3) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, \u03b8), where r is the distance from the origin and \u03b8 is the angle made with the positive x-axis. \n\nLet me recall the formulas for converting from rectangular (x, y) to polar (r, \u03b8). I think the formula for r is the square root of (x squared plus y squared). So, r = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). That makes sense because it's basically the distance from the origin to the point (x, y). \n\nAnd for \u03b8, I believe the formula is \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But wait, arctangent can sometimes give the wrong angle if the point is in a different quadrant, right? But in this case, our point is (0, 3), which is on the positive y-axis. So, I don't need to worry about the quadrant here. \n\nLet me write down the given point: (0, 3). So, x is 0 and y is 3. \n\nFirst, let's calculate r. Using the formula, r = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Plugging in the values, we get r = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3. Okay, that seems straightforward. So, r is 3.\n\nNow, onto \u03b8. The formula is \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But hold on, in this case, x is 0. So, we have \u03b8 = arctan(3/0). Hmm, division by zero is undefined. That means arctan(3/0) is approaching infinity, but in terms of angles, what does that mean?\n\nI remember that arctan(y/x) gives the angle in the correct quadrant, but when x is 0, it's either pointing straight up or straight down. Since our point is (0, 3), it's on the positive y-axis. So, \u03b8 should be \u03c0/2 radians because that's 90 degrees from the positive x-axis.\n\nLet me confirm that. When x is 0 and y is positive, the angle is indeed \u03c0/2. If y were negative, the angle would be 3\u03c0/2, but in this case, it's positive, so it's \u03c0/2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, r is 3 and \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2). \n\nWait, let me just visualize this. The point (0, 3) is 3 units up on the y-axis. In polar coordinates, that would be a line of length 3 from the origin at an angle of 90 degrees, which is \u03c0/2 radians. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The r value is straightforward, and \u03b8 is \u03c0/2 because it's directly on the positive y-axis. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polar coordinates are \\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the point \\((0, 3)\\) from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, we use the formulas for \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\). \n\nFirst, we calculate \\(r\\) using the formula \\(r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\):\n\\[\nr = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 9} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine \\(\\theta\\). Since the point is on the positive y-axis, the angle \\(\\theta\\) is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) radians.\n\nThus, the polar coordinates are \\(\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}\\).", "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>Define\n\\[p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}.\\]Find a way to write\n\\[\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\]in terms of $p$ and $q.$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to find a way to express the double sum \\(\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\) in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), where \\(p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}\\) and \\(q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}\\). Hmm, okay. Let's start by understanding what each of these sums represents.\n\nFirst, \\(p\\) is the well-known Basel problem, which sums to \\(\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\), and \\(q\\) is the sum of the reciprocals of the cubes, also known as Ap\u00e9ry's constant, which is approximately 1.2020569...\n\nBut the problem here is to express the double sum in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). So, let's think about the double sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\n\\]\n\nThis looks like a double series where each term depends on the sum of the indices \\(j\\) and \\(k\\). Maybe I can find a way to reindex this sum to make it more manageable.\n\nLet me consider substituting \\(n = j + k\\). Then, for each fixed \\(n\\), \\(j\\) can range from 1 to \\(n - 1\\), since \\(k = n - j\\) must also be at least 1. So, the double sum can be rewritten as a single sum over \\(n\\) from 2 to infinity, with each term multiplied by the number of ways to write \\(n\\) as \\(j + k\\), which is \\(n - 1\\).\n\nSo, rewriting the sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^{n - 1} \\frac{1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(j\\) ranges from 1 to \\(n - 1\\), the inner sum is just adding \\(\\frac{1}{n^3}\\) a total of \\(n - 1\\) times. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3} \\right)\n\\]\n\nNow, let's separate this into two sums:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nWe know that \\(p = \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}\\), so subtracting the first term when \\(n = 1\\) gives:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} = p - 1\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, \\(q = \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}\\), so subtracting the first term when \\(n = 1\\) gives:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} = q - 1\n\\]\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3} \\right) = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q\n\\]\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check that again. If I subtract the two sums, it's \\((p - 1) - (q - 1)\\), which simplifies to \\(p - q\\). Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me verify.\n\nStarting from the original double sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\n\\]\n\nI reindexed it to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nWhich is correct because for each \\(n\\), there are \\(n - 1\\) pairs \\((j, k)\\) such that \\(j + k = n\\). So that part is correct.\n\nThen, splitting the fraction:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3} \\right)\n\\]\n\nYes, because \\(\\frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3}\\).\n\nThen, separating the sums:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\n(p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the double sum simplifies to \\(p - q\\).\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any constants. Let's think about the original double sum again. Each term is \\(\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\), so when \\(j = 1, k = 1\\), we get \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\). The next terms would be when \\(j + k = 2\\), so \\(j=1, k=1\\), and that's it. For \\(j + k = 3\\), we have \\(j=1, k=2\\) and \\(j=2, k=1\\), each contributing \\(\\frac{1}{27}\\), so two terms. So, the total for \\(n=3\\) is \\(\\frac{2}{27}\\).\n\nWait, if \\(n\\) starts at 2, then for \\(n=2\\), the term is \\(\\frac{1}{8}\\), which is correct because only \\(j=1, k=1\\). For \\(n=3\\), two terms, each \\(\\frac{1}{27}\\), so total \\(\\frac{2}{27}\\). So, the sum is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{2}{27} + \\frac{3}{64} + \\cdots\n\\]\n\nWhich is exactly the same as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nSo, yes, that seems right.\n\nTherefore, the total sum is \\(p - q\\), where \\(p\\) is the sum of reciprocals squared and \\(q\\) is the sum of reciprocals cubed.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me compute the first few terms numerically and see if it makes sense.\n\nCompute the original double sum numerically:\n\nFirst, compute the first few terms:\n\nWhen \\(j=1, k=1\\): \\(1/(1+1)^3 = 1/8 = 0.125\\)\n\nWhen \\(j=1, k=2\\) and \\(j=2, k=1\\): each is \\(1/3^3 = 1/27 \u2248 0.037037\\), so together \u2248 0.074074\n\nWhen \\(j=1, k=3\\); \\(j=2, k=2\\); \\(j=3, k=1\\): each term is \\(1/4^3 = 1/64 \u2248 0.015625\\), so three terms: \u2248 0.046875\n\nSimilarly, for \\(n=5\\), four terms each of \\(1/5^3 = 1/125 = 0.008\\), so \u2248 0.032\n\nAdding these up:\n\n0.125 + 0.074074 \u2248 0.199074\n\n+ 0.046875 \u2248 0.245949\n\n+ 0.032 \u2248 0.277949\n\nAnd so on. It converges, but let's see what \\(p - q\\) is numerically.\n\nGiven \\(p = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n^2 \u2248 1.644934\\)\n\n\\(q = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n^3 \u2248 1.202057\\)\n\nSo, \\(p - q \u2248 1.644934 - 1.202057 \u2248 0.442877\\)\n\nBut when I added up the first four terms of the double sum, I only got \u2248 0.277949. So, clearly, the double sum converges to approximately 0.442877, which is \\(p - q\\). That seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = p - q\n\\]\n\nSo, in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), the double sum is simply \\(p - q\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe double sum can be expressed as \\(\\boxed{p - q}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo find a way to express the double sum \\(\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\) in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), where \\(p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}\\) and \\(q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}\\), we start by reindexing the sum.\n\nWe substitute \\(n = j + k\\). For each fixed \\(n\\), \\(j\\) can range from 1 to \\(n - 1\\).

Express your answer as a common fraction.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this function f(x) = (3x - 2)/(x - 2), and I need to find the sum of f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that to find f(a), I just substitute x with a in the function. So, I'll need to calculate each of these three functions separately and then add them up. Let me write them down one by one.\n\nStarting with f(-2). So, I substitute x with -2:\n\nf(-2) = [3*(-2) - 2]/[-2 - 2]\n\nLet me compute the numerator first. 3*(-2) is -6, and then subtract 2, so that becomes -6 - 2 = -8. \n\nNow the denominator: -2 - 2 is -4.\n\nSo, f(-2) is (-8)/(-4). Dividing two negatives gives a positive, so that's 2. Okay, so f(-2) is 2. That part wasn't too bad.\n\nNext, f(-1). Substitute x with -1:\n\nf(-1) = [3*(-1) - 2]/[-1 - 2]\n\nCalculating the numerator: 3*(-1) is -3, minus 2 is -5.\n\nDenominator: -1 - 2 is -3.\n\nSo, f(-1) is (-5)/(-3). Again, negatives cancel out, so it's 5/3. Hmm, 5/3 is a fraction, okay, I'll keep that in mind.\n\nNow, f(0). Substitute x with 0:\n\nf(0) = [3*0 - 2]/[0 - 2]\n\nNumerator: 3*0 is 0, minus 2 is -2.\n\nDenominator: 0 - 2 is -2.\n\nSo, f(0) is (-2)/(-2), which is 1. That's straightforward.\n\nAlright, so now I have f(-2) = 2, f(-1) = 5/3, and f(0) = 1. I need to add them together:\n\n2 + 5/3 + 1.\n\nLet me convert all terms to fractions to add them up easily. 2 is 2/1, which is equivalent to 6/3, and 1 is 1/1, which is 3/3.\n\nSo, adding them:\n\n6/3 + 5/3 + 3/3 = (6 + 5 + 3)/3 = 14/3.\n\nWait, hold on. 6 + 5 is 11, plus 3 is 14, so 14/3. Hmm, but 14/3 is an improper fraction. The question says to express the answer as a common fraction, so 14/3 should be fine.\n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, f(-2):\n\nNumerator: 3*(-2) = -6; -6 -2 = -8. Denominator: -2 -2 = -4. So, -8/-4 = 2. Correct.\n\nf(-1):\n\nNumerator: 3*(-1) = -3; -3 -2 = -5. Denominator: -1 -2 = -3. So, -5/-3 = 5/3. Correct.\n\nf(0):\n\nNumerator: 3*0 = 0; 0 -2 = -2. Denominator: 0 -2 = -2. So, -2/-2 = 1. Correct.\n\nAdding them: 2 + 5/3 + 1. Let's do this step by step:\n\n2 + 1 = 3. Then, 3 + 5/3. 3 is 9/3, so 9/3 + 5/3 = 14/3. Yep, that seems right.\n\nWait, but 14/3 is equal to 4 and 2/3. Is that the simplest form? I think so because 14 and 3 don't have any common factors besides 1. So, 14/3 is the reduced form.\n\nHmm, so I think I did everything correctly. Maybe I should just go through the function once more to ensure I didn't substitute wrong or make any arithmetic errors.\n\nf(-2): Plug in x = -2: (3*(-2) - 2)/( -2 - 2) = (-6 - 2)/(-4) = (-8)/(-4) = 2. Correct.\n\nf(-1): Plug in x = -1: (3*(-1) - 2)/(-1 - 2) = (-3 - 2)/(-3) = (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. Correct.\n\nf(0): Plug in x = 0: (0 - 2)/(0 - 2) = (-2)/(-2) = 1. Correct.\n\nAdding them: 2 + 5/3 + 1. As fractions, 2 is 6/3, 1 is 3/3, so 6/3 + 5/3 + 3/3 = 14/3. Yep, that's correct.\n\nI think I'm confident that the answer is 14/3. Let me just visualize the steps again in my mind to ensure there's no mistake.\n\nAnother way is to compute each function value step by step:\n\nf(-2):\n\n3*(-2) = -6\n\n-6 - 2 = -8\n\nDenominator: -2 -2 = -4\n\nSo, -8 divided by -4 is 2. Correct.\n\nf(-1):\n\n3*(-1) = -3\n\n-3 -2 = -5\n\nDenominator: -1 -2 = -3\n\nSo, -5 divided by -3 is 5/3. Correct.\n\nf(0):\n\n3*0 = 0\n\n0 -2 = -2\n\nDenominator: 0 -2 = -2\n\nSo, -2 divided by -2 is 1. Correct.\n\nAdding them: 2 + 5/3 + 1.\n\nConverting 2 to thirds: 6/3\n\n1 is 3/3\n\nAdding: 6/3 + 5/3 = 11/3\n\nThen, 11/3 + 3/3 = 14/3.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The function is straightforward, and each substitution was done correctly. The arithmetic seems right. So, I think 14/3 is the right answer.\n\nJust to make sure, maybe I can plug in the values into the function another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write f(x) as a different expression to see if it simplifies, but I don't think that's necessary here since the substitution seems fine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check if f(x) can be simplified. Let me try:\n\nf(x) = (3x - 2)/(x - 2). Is there a way to factor numerator or denominator? The numerator is 3x - 2, which can't be factored further, and the denominator is x - 2, which is also prime. So, no simplification there.\n\nTherefore, substitution is the correct method.\n\nAlright, so after double-checking all steps, I'm confident that f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) equals 14/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) for the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{3x - 2}{x - 2} \\), we need to evaluate the function at each specified point and then sum the results.\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( f(-2) \\):\n\\[\nf(-2) = \\frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \\frac{-6 - 2}{-4} = \\frac{-8}{-4} = 2\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( f(-1) \\):\n\\[\nf(-1) = \\frac{3(-1) - 2}{-1 - 2} = \\frac{-3 - 2}{-3} = \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3}\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate \\( f(0) \\):\n\\[\nf(0) = \\frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} = \\frac{0 - 2}{-2} = \\frac{-2}{-2} = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the results:\n\\[\nf(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + \\frac{5}{3} + 1\n\\]\n\nConverting all terms to fractions with a common denominator:\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{6}{3}, \\quad 1 = \\frac{3}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{3} + \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{6 + 5 + 3}{3} = \\frac{14}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}.", "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has. Hmm, okay. I remember that to find the number of divisors, I need to look at the prime factorization of the number first. Once I have that, I can use a formula to determine the total number of divisors. Let me try to recall the steps.\n\nFirst, let me start by understanding what a divisor is. A divisor of a number is another number that divides it without leaving a remainder. So, for example, 1 is a divisor of every number, and the number itself is also a divisor. But I need to find all such numbers for 196.\n\nI think the systematic way to do this is to perform prime factorization on 196. Prime factorization is breaking down a composite number into a product of its prime factors. Once I have the prime factors, I can use the exponents of these primes to calculate the number of divisors.\n\nOkay, let's do that. So, I need to divide 196 by prime numbers until I'm left with 1. Let's start with the smallest prime, which is 2.\n\n196 divided by 2 is 98. Okay, that's one 2. 98 is still even, so I can divide by 2 again. 98 divided by 2 is 49. So now I have two 2s.\n\nNext, 49 is not even, so I can't divide by 2 anymore. Let me try the next prime number, which is 3. 49 divided by 3 is not a whole number because 3 times 16 is 48, and 49 minus 48 is 1, so there's a remainder. So, 3 is not a factor.\n\nMoving on to the next prime, which is 5. Well, 49 ends with a 9, so it's not divisible by 5. Next prime is 7. Let's try that.\n\n49 divided by 7 is 7. Perfect, no remainder. So, that's one 7. Now, we have 7 left, which is still a prime number, so we divide it by 7 again. 7 divided by 7 is 1. So, that's two 7s.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the prime factors of 196 are 2 squared times 7 squared, or \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\). That seems right because \\(2 \\times 2 \\times 7 \\times 7\\) is 196.\n\nNow, I remember that the formula for finding the number of divisors is to take the exponents of the prime factors, add 1 to each of them, and then multiply those together. So, in this case, the exponents are 2 and 2 for primes 2 and 7, respectively.\n\nSo, adding 1 to each exponent: 2 + 1 = 3, and 2 + 1 = 3. Then, multiply those results: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9. So, does that mean 196 has 9 positive divisors?\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that correctly. Maybe I should list them out to check.\n\nStarting with 1 and 196. Then, since 196 is even, 2 is a divisor, and 196 divided by 2 is 98. So, 2 and 98. Next, 196 divided by 4 is 49, so 4 and 49. Then, 7 is a divisor because 196 divided by 7 is 28, so 7 and 28. Then, 14 is a divisor because 196 divided by 14 is 14, which is the same number, so 14 is repeated. Hmm, wait, actually, 14 is a divisor, but since 14 times 14 is 196, does that count as a square?\n\nLet me list them all step by step:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196.\n\nLet me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Yep, that's 9 divisors. So, my formula gave me the correct answer, which is reassuring.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't miss any, let me think about how I found them. I started with 1 and 196, then checked for small primes and their multiples. Since 196 is a square number, 14 times 14, so 14 is also a divisor in the middle.\n\nI think that covers all the possible divisors because any other number would either not divide evenly or would be a repeat. For example, 3 isn't a divisor because 196 divided by 3 is not a whole number, as I saw earlier. Similarly, 5 isn't a divisor because 196 doesn't end with a 0 or 5. So, the only primes that divide into 196 are 2 and 7.\n\nTherefore, by both methods\u2014using the prime factorization formula and listing them out\u2014I arrived at 9 divisors. That gives me confidence that the answer is correct.\n\nI guess another way to think about it is that each divisor is of the form \\(2^a \\times 7^b\\), where \\(a\\) can be 0, 1, or 2, and \\(b\\) can be 0, 1, or 2. So, the number of combinations is 3 choices for \\(a\\) and 3 choices for \\(b\\), which is 9 in total. That also makes sense because each exponent represents how many times the prime can be used in a divisor\u2014either not at all (0), once (1), or twice (2). So, all possible combinations will give a unique divisor.\n\nLet me verify that with an example. If \\(a=0\\) and \\(b=0\\), that's 1. If \\(a=1\\) and \\(b=0\\), that's 2. If \\(a=2\\) and \\(b=0\\), that's 4. Similarly, \\(a=0\\) and \\(b=1\\) is 7, \\(a=0\\) and \\(b=2\\) is 49. Then, \\(a=1\\) and \\(b=1\\) is 14, \\(a=1\\) and \\(b=2\\) is 98. Finally, \\(a=2\\) and \\(b=1\\) is 28, and \\(a=2\\) and \\(b=2\\) is 196. Yep, that covers all 9 divisors.\n\nSo, I think I'm confident that the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is 9. I don't think I made any mistakes in my reasoning, and both methods\u2014prime factorization formula and enumerating the divisors\u2014gave the same result. It's always good to cross-verify, especially when dealing with mathematical concepts.\n\nIn summary, by breaking down 196 into its prime factors, using the formula to calculate the number of divisors, and then listing them out to confirm, I arrived at the conclusion that 196 has 9 positive divisors. I feel pretty sure about this now.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, we start by finding its prime factorization. \n\n196 is divided by 2:\n\\[ 196 \\div 2 = 98 \\]\n98 is divided by 2 again:\n\\[ 98 \\div 2 = 49 \\]\n49 is divided by 7:\n\\[ 49 \\div 7 = 7 \\]\n7 is divided by 7 again:\n\\[ 7 \\div 7 = 1 \\]\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n\\[ 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\]\n\nUsing the formula for the number of divisors, we take the exponents of the prime factors, add 1 to each, and multiply the results:\n\\[ (2 + 1) \\times (2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\nTo verify, we list all the divisors of 196: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. There are 9 divisors in total.\n\nThus, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}."]
