["Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to convert the rectangular coordinates (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, polar coordinates are represented as (r, \u03b8), right? I remember that r is the distance from the origin to the point, and \u03b8 is the angle made with the positive x-axis. \n\nFirst, I think I need to find r. I recall the formula for r in polar coordinates is the square root of (x squared plus y squared). So, in this case, the point is (0, 3), which means x is 0 and y is 3. Let me write that down:\n\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2)\nr = \u221a(0 + 9)\nr = \u221a9\nr = 3\n\nOkay, so r is 3. That makes sense because the point is 3 units away from the origin on the y-axis.\n\nNow, I need to find \u03b8, the angle. I remember that \u03b8 can be found using the arctangent function, specifically \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But wait, in this case, x is 0. Hmm, arctan(3/0) is undefined because we can't divide by zero. That means the angle isn't just any arctangent; I need to figure out where on the unit circle this point lies.\n\nSince x is 0 and y is positive, the point is on the positive y-axis. On the unit circle, the positive y-axis corresponds to an angle of \u03c0/2 radians, which is 90 degrees. Let me confirm that. If \u03b8 is \u03c0/2, then the coordinates in rectangular form would be (r*cos\u03b8, r*sin\u03b8). Plugging in, we get (3*cos(\u03c0/2), 3*sin(\u03c0/2)). Cos(\u03c0/2) is 0 and sin(\u03c0/2) is 1, so that gives us (0, 3), which matches the original point. Perfect, that seems right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2). Let me just make sure that \u03b8 is within the specified range of 0 \u2264 \u03b8 < 2\u03c0. Since \u03c0/2 is approximately 1.57 radians, it's well within that range. Also, r is positive, as required. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The point is straightforward because it lies on the y-axis, making \u03b8 a standard angle. If it had been on the x-axis, \u03b8 would have been 0 or \u03c0, but since it's on the y-axis, it's \u03c0/2. \n\nAnother way to think about it is using the four quadrants. Since the point is (0, 3), it's on the positive y-axis, which is between the positive x-axis and the negative x-axis going up. So, the angle from the positive x-axis is 90 degrees or \u03c0/2 radians.\n\nJust to recap, r is the distance from the origin, which is 3, and \u03b8 is the angle from the positive x-axis, which is \u03c0/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2). I don't see any issues with this reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polar coordinates are \\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the rectangular coordinates \\((0, 3)\\) to polar coordinates, we need to find \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\).\n\nFirst, we calculate \\(r\\) using the formula:\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\]\nSubstituting \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = 3\\):\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\]\n\nNext, we determine \\(\\theta\\). Since the point \\((0, 3)\\) lies on the positive y-axis, the angle \\(\\theta\\) is \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) radians (or 90 degrees).\n\nThus, the polar coordinates are:\n\\[ (r, \\theta) = \\left(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\]\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}\\).", "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>Define\n\\[p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}.\\]Find a way to write\n\\[\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\]in terms of $p$ and $q.$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I've got this problem where I need to express the double sum \\(\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\) in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), where \\(p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}\\) and \\(q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}\\). Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\(p\\) is the well-known Basel problem, which sums to \\(\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\), but here we're just representing it as \\(p\\). Similarly, \\(q\\) is the Riemann zeta function at 3, which doesn't have a simple closed-form expression, but again, we're representing it as \\(q\\). So the task is to express the double sum in terms of these two.\n\nLooking at the double sum, it's over all positive integers \\(j\\) and \\(k\\), and the term is \\(\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\). So, each term depends on the sum \\(j + k\\). Maybe I can reindex this sum somehow to make it more manageable.\n\nLet me think: if I fix the value of \\(n = j + k\\), then for each \\(n\\), \\(j\\) can range from 1 to \\(n - 1\\), and \\(k\\) would be \\(n - j\\). So, perhaps I can rewrite the double sum as a single sum over \\(n\\) and then sum over the possible \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) that give that \\(n\\).\n\nLet me try that. So,\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^{n - 1} \\frac{1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nYes, that makes sense because for each \\(n \\geq 2\\), there are \\(n - 1\\) pairs \\((j, k)\\) such that \\(j + k = n\\). So, the inner sum is just counting how many ways \\(n\\) can be expressed as \\(j + k\\), which is \\(n - 1\\).\n\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nOkay, so that's a single sum now. Let me write that as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3} \\right )\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(\\frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3}\\). Nice, so now I can split this into two separate sums:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{1^2} \\right ) - \\left( \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} - \\frac{1}{1^3} \\right )\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this, since \\(p = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}\\) and \\(q = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}\\):\n\n\\[\n(p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q\n\\]\n\nWait, so does that mean the original double sum is equal to \\(p - q\\)? That seems too straightforward. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, I changed the double sum into a single sum by fixing \\(n = j + k\\). That seems correct because for each \\(n\\), there are \\(n - 1\\) pairs \\((j, k)\\) such that \\(j + k = n\\). Then, I expressed \\(\\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\\) as \\(\\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3}\\), which is algebraically correct.\n\nNext, I split the sum into two separate sums, each starting from \\(n=2\\). Then, I adjusted each of those sums to start from \\(n=1\\) by subtracting the \\(n=1\\) term. That is, for the first sum, \\(\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} = p - 1\\), since the \\(n=1\\) term is 1. Similarly, for the second sum, \\(\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} = q - 1\\). So, subtracting these gives \\((p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q\\).\n\nWait, so it seems correct. The double sum is equal to \\(p - q\\). Hmm, let me verify with a small example. Let's compute the original double sum for \\(j, k\\) up to 2 and see if it approximates \\(p - q\\) when \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are approximated up to the same terms.\n\nCompute \\(\\sum_{j=1}^2 \\sum_{k=1}^2 \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n- \\(j=1, k=1\\): \\(\\frac{1}{(2)^3} = \\frac{1}{8}\\)\n- \\(j=1, k=2\\): \\(\\frac{1}{(3)^3} = \\frac{1}{27}\\)\n- \\(j=2, k=1\\): \\(\\frac{1}{(3)^3} = \\frac{1}{27}\\)\n- \\(j=2, k=2\\): \\(\\frac{1}{(4)^3} = \\frac{1}{64}\\)\n\nSo, total is \\(\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{27} + \\frac{1}{27} + \\frac{1}{64}\\).\n\nCalculate that:\n\nConvert to decimal:\n\n\\(\\frac{1}{8} = 0.125\\), \\(\\frac{1}{27} \\approx 0.037037\\), \\(\\frac{1}{64} \\approx 0.015625\\).\n\nSo total is approximately \\(0.125 + 0.037037 + 0.037037 + 0.015625 = 0.2147\\).\n\nNow, compute \\(p - q\\) up to \\(n=2\\):\n\n\\(p = 1 + \\frac{1}{4} = 1.25\\), \\(q = 1 + \\frac{1}{8} = 1.125\\), so \\(p - q = 0.125\\).\n\nWait, but our computed double sum is approximately 0.2147, which is bigger than 0.125. Hmm, that suggests that maybe my earlier conclusion is incorrect? Or perhaps because we're only summing up to \\(n=2\\) in \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), the approximation isn't good enough.\n\nWait, let me compute more terms. Let's take \\(p\\) up to \\(n=3\\): \\(1 + 1/4 + 1/9 \\approx 1.3611\\). \\(q\\) up to \\(n=3\\): \\(1 + 1/8 + 1/27 \\approx 1.1481\\). So, \\(p - q \\approx 0.213\\), which is close to our computed double sum of approximately 0.2147. So, that seems to align better.\n\nSo, when I take more terms, \\(p - q\\) approximates the partial double sum better. So, my initial conclusion that the double sum equals \\(p - q\\) seems correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is \\(p - q\\).\n\nBut just to make sure, let me consider another approach. Maybe using generating functions or integral representations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express the double sum as a convolution of two sequences. Since \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) are independent, the term \\(\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\) is the convolution of \\(\\frac{1}{j^3}\\) and \\(\\frac{1}{k^3}\\). But I'm not sure if that helps directly.\n\nWait, but actually, the double sum can be thought of as a convolution. So, the sum over \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) of \\(a_j b_k\\) where \\(a_j = \\frac{1}{j^3}\\) and \\(b_k = \\frac{1}{k^3}\\), but the term is \\(\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\), which is a bit different.\n\nWait, actually, no. The convolution of two sequences \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) is \\(c_n = \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} a_k b_{n - k}\\). But in our case, the term is \\(\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\), which is not exactly the product of \\(a_j\\) and \\(b_k\\), but rather a function of \\(j + k\\). So maybe it's not a standard convolution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the integral representation of \\(\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\). Since \\(\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} x^{j + k - 1} \\ln x \\, dx\\). Hmm, let me verify that.\n\nRecall that \\(\\int_{0}^{1} x^{n} dx = \\frac{1}{n + 1}\\). Differentiating both sides with respect to \\(n\\), we get \\(\\int_{0}^{1} x^{n} \\ln x \\, dx = -\\frac{1}{(n + 1)^2}\\). Differentiating again, \\(\\int_{0}^{1} x^{n} (\\ln x)^2 \\, dx = \\frac{2}{(n + 1)^3}\\). Hmm, close but not exactly what we have. Alternatively, integrating once:\n\nWait, \\(\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} x^{j + k - 1} (\\ln x)^2 dx\\). Let me check:\n\nWe know that \\(\\int_{0}^{1} x^{m} (\\ln x)^n dx = (-1)^n \\frac{n!}{(m + 1)^{n + 1}}\\). So, for \\(n=2\\), it's \\(2!/(m + 1)^3 = 2/(m + 1)^3\\). Therefore, \\(\\int_{0}^{1} x^{m} (\\ln x)^2 dx = 2/(m + 1)^3\\), which implies that \\(\\frac{1}{(m + 1)^3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} x^{m} (\\ln x)^2 dx\\).\n\nSo, substituting \\(m = j + k - 1\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} x^{j + k - 1} (\\ln x)^2 dx\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the double sum becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\int_{0}^{1} x^{j + k - 1} (\\ln x)^2 dx\n\\]\n\nSince the integral is linear, we can interchange the sum and the integral (if convergence is okay):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} (\\ln x)^2 \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty x^{j} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty x^{k} dx\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(x^{j + k - 1} = x^{-1} x^{j} x^{k}\\), so we can factor out \\(x^{-1}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} x^{-1} (\\ln x)^2 \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty x^{j} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty x^{k} dx\n\\]\n\nNow, the sums \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty x^{j}\\) and \\(\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty x^{k}\\) are both equal to \\(\\frac{x}{1 - x}\\) for \\(|x| < 1\\). Therefore,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} x^{-1} (\\ln x)^2 \\left( \\frac{x}{1 - x} \\right )^2 dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} (\\ln x)^2 \\frac{x^2}{(1 - x)^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} (\\ln x)^2 \\frac{x}{(1 - x)^2} dx\n\\]\n\nSimplify the integrand:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x (\\ln x)^2}{(1 - x)^2} dx\n\\]\n\nHmm, okay. Now, this seems like a more complicated integral, but maybe we can relate it back to \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Let's see.\n\nLet me denote \\(I = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{x (\\ln x)^2}{(1 - x)^2} dx\\). Maybe I can perform a substitution. Let \\(t = 1 - x\\), so \\(x = 1 - t\\), \\(dx = -dt\\), and when \\(x = 0\\), \\(t = 1\\); when \\(x = 1\\), \\(t = 0\\). So,\n\n\\[\nI = \\int_{1}^{0} \\frac{(1 - t) (\\ln (1 - t))^2}{t^2} (-dt) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{(1 - t) (\\ln (1 - t))^2}{t^2} dt\n\\]\n\nWhich is:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{(1 - t)}{t^2} (\\ln (1 - t))^2 dt = \\int_{0}^{1} \\left( \\frac{1}{t^2} - \\frac{1}{t} \\right ) (\\ln (1 - t))^2 dt\n\\]\n\nSo, split the integral into two parts:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{(\\ln (1 - t))^2}{t^2} dt - \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{(\\ln (1 - t))^2}{t} dt\n\\]\n\nLet me denote these as \\(I_1\\) and \\(I_2\\), respectively. So, \\(I = I_1 - I_2\\).\n\nNow, I need to evaluate these integrals. Hmm, I remember that integrals involving \\(\\ln(1 - t)\\) can sometimes be related to the Riemann zeta function or other special functions.\n\nLet me consider expanding \\(\\ln(1 - t)\\) as a power series. Recall that:\n\n\\[\n\\ln(1 - t) = -\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{t^n}{n}\n\\]\n\nSo, \\((\\ln(1 - t))^2 = \\left( -\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{t^n}{n} \\right )^2 = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\frac{t^{n + m}}{nm}\\).\n\nTherefore, \\((\\ln(1 - t))^2 = \\sum_{k=2}^\\infty \\left( \\sum_{m=1}^{k - 1} \\frac{1}{m(k - m)} \\right ) t^k\\).\n\nWait, that might be helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can use known integrals.\n\nI recall that:\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{(\\ln(1 - t))^2}{t} dt = 2 \\zeta(3)\n\\]\n\nAnd,\n\n\\[\n\\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{(\\ln(1 - t))^2}{t^2} dt = 2 \\zeta(3) + 2 \\zeta(2)\n\\]\n\nWait, let me verify that.\n\nFirst, for \\(I_2 = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{(\\ln(1 - t))^2}{t} dt\\). I think this is a known integral. Let me make substitution \\(u = -\\ln(1 - t)\\), so \\(t = 1 - e^{-u}\\), \\(dt = e^{-u} du\\), when \\(t=0\\), \\(u=0\\); \\(t=1\\), \\(u=\\infty\\).

Similarly, let's compute \\(I_1 = \\int_{0}^{1} \\frac{(\\ln(1 - t))^2}{t^2} dt\\).\n\nAgain, let me use substitution \\(u = -\\ln(1 - t)\\), so \\(t = 1 - e^{-u}\\), \\(dt = e^{-u} du\\). Then,\n\n\\[\nI_1 = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{u^2}{(1 - e^{-u})^2} e^{-u} du\n\\]\n\nHmm, seems more complicated.

The generating function for \\(n\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n x^{n} = \\frac{x}{(1 - x)^2}\n\\]\n\nSo, if I set \\(x = e^{-u}\\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n e^{-n u} = \\frac{e^{-u}}{(1 - e^{-u})^2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{(1 - e^{-u})^2} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n e^{-(n - 1)u}\n\\]\n\nSo, substituting back into \\(I_1\\):\n\n\\[\nI_1 = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^2 e^{-u} \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n e^{-(n - 1)u} du = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^2 e^{-(n)u} du\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(e^{-u} \\cdot e^{-(n - 1)u} = e^{-n u}\\).\n\nSo, \\(I_1 = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n \\cdot \\frac{2}{n^3} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{2}{n^2} = 2 p\\).\n\nWait, hold on: the integral \\(\\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^2 e^{-a u} du = \\frac{2}{a^3}\\). So, here \\(a = n\\), so:\n\n\\[\nI_1 = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n \\cdot \\frac{2}{n^3} = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{2}{n^2} = 2 p\n\\]\n\nTherefore, \\(I_1 = 2 p\\).

Express your answer as a common fraction.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this function f(x) = (3x - 2)/(x - 2), and I need to find the value of f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0). Hmm, let me break this down step by step. I think I should calculate each function value separately and then add them up. \n\nFirst, let's find f(-2). To do that, I substitute x = -2 into the function. So, the numerator becomes 3*(-2) - 2. Let me compute that: 3*(-2) is -6, and then subtract 2, so that's -6 - 2 = -8. \n\nNow, the denominator when x is -2 is (-2) - 2. That simplifies to -4. So, f(-2) is (-8)/(-4). Dividing two negatives should give me a positive, so that's 2. Okay, so f(-2) is 2. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext up is f(-1). Again, I substitute x = -1 into the function. Numerator becomes 3*(-1) - 2. 3*(-1) is -3, minus 2 is -5. Denominator is (-1) - 2, which is -3. So, f(-1) is (-5)/(-3). Dividing two negatives gives a positive, so that's 5/3. Alright, f(-1) is 5/3.\n\nNow, onto f(0). Substituting x = 0 into the function. Numerator is 3*0 - 2, which is 0 - 2 = -2. Denominator is 0 - 2 = -2. So, f(0) is (-2)/(-2). That's 1. Simple enough, f(0) is 1.\n\nSo, now I have f(-2) = 2, f(-1) = 5/3, and f(0) = 1. I need to add them all together: 2 + 5/3 + 1. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, add 2 and 1. 2 + 1 is 3. So now, I have 3 + 5/3. To add these, it's easier if I express 3 as a fraction with denominator 3. 3 is the same as 9/3. So, 9/3 + 5/3 is (9 + 5)/3 = 14/3.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I did that right. 2 + 1 is definitely 3. Then, 3 is 9/3, yes. Adding 5/3 gives 14/3. Hmm, but 14/3 is an improper fraction. The question asks for a common fraction, so 14/3 is already a common fraction, but maybe I should check if I can reduce it or if I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me double-check each function value:\n\nFor f(-2): (3*(-2) - 2)/( -2 - 2) = (-6 - 2)/(-4) = (-8)/(-4) = 2. That's correct.\n\nFor f(-1): (3*(-1) - 2)/(-1 - 2) = (-3 - 2)/(-3) = (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. That's right.\n\nFor f(0): (3*0 - 2)/(0 - 2) = (-2)/(-2) = 1. Correct.\n\nSo, adding them up: 2 + 5/3 + 1. Let me convert all to thirds to add them:\n\n2 is 6/3, 5/3 is 5/3, and 1 is 3/3. So, adding them: 6/3 + 5/3 + 3/3 = (6 + 5 + 3)/3 = 14/3. Yep, that's 14/3. \n\nWait, 14/3 is equal to 4 and 2/3, but since the question asks for a common fraction, 14/3 is the appropriate form. So, I think that's the answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic mistakes. Let me go through each calculation again.\n\nf(-2): (3*(-2) - 2) = -6 -2 = -8. Denominator: -2 -2 = -4. So, -8 divided by -4 is indeed 2. Correct.\n\nf(-1): 3*(-1) = -3. -3 -2 = -5. Denominator: -1 -2 = -3. So, -5 divided by -3 is 5/3. Correct.\n\nf(0): 3*0 = 0. 0 -2 = -2. Denominator: 0 -2 = -2. So, -2 divided by -2 is 1. Correct.\n\nAdding them: 2 + 5/3 + 1. Let me add 2 and 1 first: 3. Then, 3 is 9/3, so 9/3 + 5/3 is 14/3. Correct. \n\nI think that's solid. So, the sum is 14/3. \n\nWait, just to make sure, is 14/3 reducible? 14 and 3 have no common factors besides 1, so yeah, 14/3 is the simplest form. So, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) for the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{3x - 2}{x - 2} \\), we calculate each function value separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( f(-2) \\):\n\\[\nf(-2) = \\frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \\frac{-6 - 2}{-4} = \\frac{-8}{-4} = 2\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( f(-1) \\):\n\\[\nf(-1) = \\frac{3(-1) - 2}{-1 - 2} = \\frac{-3 - 2}{-3} = \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3}\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate \\( f(0) \\):\n\\[\nf(0) = \\frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} = \\frac{-2}{-2} = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the values:\n\\[\nf(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + \\frac{5}{3} + 1\n\\]\n\nConverting all terms to a common denominator (3) to add them:\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{6}{3}, \\quad 1 = \\frac{3}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{3} + \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{6 + 5 + 3}{3} = \\frac{14}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}\\).", "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has. Hmm, divisors are numbers that divide 196 without leaving a remainder. I remember that to find the number of divisors, I need to look at the prime factorization of the number. Once I have that, there's a method involving exponents to calculate the total number of divisors. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFirst, I think I need to break down 196 into its prime factors. Prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. So, starting with the smallest prime number, which is 2.\n\n196 divided by 2 is 98. Okay, so 2 is a prime factor. Now, 98 can be divided by 2 again. 98 divided by 2 is 49. So, that's another 2. Now, 49 is left. 49 is a number I recognize as 7 squared, right? So, 49 divided by 7 is 7, and then 7 divided by 7 is 1. So, putting that all together, the prime factors of 196 are 2, 2, 7, 7. Or, in exponent form, that's 2 squared times 7 squared.\n\nWait, let me write that down to make sure I got it right:\n\n196 \u00f7 2 = 98  \n98 \u00f7 2 = 49  \n49 \u00f7 7 = 7  \n7 \u00f7 7 = 1\n\nSo, yeah, 196 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2. That looks right.\n\nNow, I remember that the formula for finding the number of divisors is to take the exponents of the prime factors, add one to each of them, and then multiply those together. So, in this case, the exponents are 2 and 2 for primes 2 and 7, respectively.\n\nSo, adding one to each exponent: 2 + 1 = 3 and 2 + 1 = 3. Then multiply those results: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9. So, does that mean 196 has 9 positive divisors?\n\nLet me verify that by listing them out to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I list all the numbers that divide 196 without a remainder, they should be:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196.\n\nLet me count them: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. That's 9 numbers. Okay, so that checks out.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't skip any or include any extra, let me think. Starting from 1 and going up:\n\n1 \u00d7 196 = 196  \n2 \u00d7 98 = 196  \n4 \u00d7 49 = 196  \n7 \u00d7 28 = 196  \n14 \u00d7 14 = 196\n\nWait, hold on, 14 \u00d7 14 is 196, so that's a perfect square. So, that would mean that 14 is the square root of 196, right? Which is correct because 14 squared is 196.\n\nSo, the divisors come in pairs: (1, 196), (2, 98), (4, 49), (7, 28), (14, 14). Since 14 is repeated, we don't count it twice, so that gives us 5 pairs, but because 14 is the square root, we have an odd number of total divisors. So, 9 in total.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that each exponent in the prime factorization can be zero or more up to the exponent in the factorization. So, for 2\u00b2, the exponents can be 0, 1, or 2. Similarly, for 7\u00b2, the exponents can be 0, 1, or 2. So, the number of combinations is 3 (for 2) multiplied by 3 (for 7), which is 9.\n\nTherefore, both methods give me the same result, so I think it's safe to say that 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the prime factorization, let me double-check:\n\n2\u00b2 is 4, and 7\u00b2 is 49. 4 \u00d7 49 is indeed 196. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, all in all, I think I'm confident that the number of positive divisors of 196 is 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, we start by finding its prime factorization.\n\n196 divided by 2 is 98.  \n98 divided by 2 is 49.  \n49 divided by 7 is 7.  \n7 divided by 7 is 1.\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 196 is \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\nNext, we use the formula for finding the number of divisors. We take the exponents of the prime factors, add one to each, and then multiply the results. The exponents are 2 and 2 for primes 2 and 7, respectively.\n\nAdding one to each exponent:  \n\\(2 + 1 = 3\\)  \n\\(2 + 1 = 3\\)\n\nMultiplying these results:  \n\\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\)\n\nTherefore, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}."]
