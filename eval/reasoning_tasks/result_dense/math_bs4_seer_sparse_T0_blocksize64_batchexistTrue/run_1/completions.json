Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinates (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, okay, let's see. I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, \u03b8), where r is the distance from the origin and \u03b8 is the angle made with the positive x-axis. \n\nFirst, I should recall the formulas for converting from rectangular (x, y) to polar (r, \u03b8). I think the formula for r is the square root of (x squared plus y squared). So, r = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). That seems right because it's basically the distance formula from the origin to the point.\n\nGiven the point (0, 3), let's plug in the values. So, x is 0 and y is 3. Therefore, r = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3. Okay, that part seems straightforward. So, r is 3.\n\nNow, onto finding \u03b8, the angle. I remember there's a formula for \u03b8 as well. I think it's \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But wait, I have to be careful here because if x is 0, arctan(y/x) would be arctan(3/0), which is undefined. Hmm, so what does that mean?\n\nWhen x is 0, the point lies somewhere on the y-axis. So, if x is 0 and y is positive, the point is on the positive y-axis. I remember that in the unit circle, the angle for the positive y-axis is \u03c0/2 radians, which is 90 degrees. So, \u03b8 should be \u03c0/2. Let me just confirm that.\n\nIf x is 0, then the point is either at the top or the bottom of the y-axis. Since y is positive here (3), it's on the positive y-axis, so \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. If y were negative, it would be 3\u03c0/2, but in this case, it's positive, so \u03c0/2 is correct.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating r. So, x is 0, y is 3. So, r squared is 0 squared plus 3 squared, which is 0 + 9 = 9. So, r is the square root of 9, which is 3. Yep, that seems right.\n\nWait, is there another way to think about \u03b8? Maybe using the cosine or sine function? Because sometimes when x is 0, the angle can be determined by the sign of y. Since y is positive, the angle is \u03c0/2. If y were negative, it would be 3\u03c0/2. So, in this case, it's definitely \u03c0/2.\n\nLet me also visualize this. If I plot the point (0, 3) on the rectangular coordinate system, it's straight up on the y-axis, 3 units away from the origin. So, in polar coordinates, the distance from the origin is 3, and the angle from the positive x-axis is 90 degrees or \u03c0/2 radians. That makes sense.\n\nI think I'm confident with this. So, putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2). \n\nWait, just to double-check, let's convert back from polar to rectangular to see if we get the original point. The formulas for converting back are x = r*cos\u03b8 and y = r*sin\u03b8. So, plugging in r = 3 and \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, we get x = 3*cos(\u03c0/2). Cos(\u03c0/2) is 0, so x = 0. Then y = 3*sin(\u03c0/2). Sin(\u03c0/2) is 1, so y = 3*1 = 3. Perfect, that's exactly the original point (0, 3). So, my conversion must be correct.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. The key steps were calculating r using the distance formula and figuring out \u03b8 based on the position on the y-axis. Since x was 0 and y was positive, \u03b8 was \u03c0/2.\n\nAnother thing I might consider is the range for \u03b8. The problem specifies that \u03b8 should be between 0 and 2\u03c0. Since \u03c0/2 is within that range, we're good. If \u03b8 had come out to be negative or greater than 2\u03c0, we would have had to adjust it accordingly, but in this case, \u03c0/2 is just right.\n\nSo, summarizing my steps:\n\n1. Calculate r using r = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Plugged in (0, 3), got r = 3.\n2. Determine \u03b8 by recognizing the point is on the positive y-axis, so \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\n3. Verified by converting back to rectangular coordinates and confirming it matches the original point.\n4. Ensured \u03b8 is within the specified range.\n\nI don't think I missed anything here. It was a pretty straightforward problem, but it's good to go through each step methodically to avoid mistakes.\n\nWait, just thinking about another aspect: if the point were on the negative y-axis, \u03b8 would be 3\u03c0/2, right? Since it's directly downward. But since our y is positive, we don't have to worry about that here.\n\nAlso, if x had not been zero, we could have used \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But since x is zero, that formula is undefined, so we had to reason it out based on the location on the y-axis.\n\nI guess another way to think about \u03b8 is by considering the four quadrants. Since x is 0, the point isn't in any specific quadrant but lies on the axis. So, if x is 0 and y is positive, it's on the positive y-axis, which is \u03b8 = \u03c0/2. If x is 0 and y is negative, it's on the negative y-axis, \u03b8 = 3\u03c0/2. Similarly, if y is 0, the point is on the x-axis: \u03b8 = 0 for positive x-axis and \u03b8 = \u03c0 for negative x-axis.\n\nSo, this knowledge helps in determining \u03b8 when dealing with points on the axes, where x or y is zero.\n\nJust to explore a bit more, let's say we have a point like (0, -3). Then, r would still be 3, but \u03b8 would be 3\u03c0/2. Similarly, if we have a point (4, 0), r is 4, \u03b8 is 0. If it's (-4, 0), r is 4, \u03b8 is \u03c0. So, these are the special cases when dealing with polar coordinates.\n\nIn our problem, since we're dealing with (0, 3), it's on the positive y-axis, so \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. That's straightforward.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. Calculated r correctly, figured out \u03b8 by understanding the position on the coordinate system, checked my work by converting back, and even thought about similar cases to solidify my understanding.\n\nSo, yeah, I'm pretty confident now that the polar coordinates for (0, 3) are (3, \u03c0/2). No mistakes detected in my reasoning, and everything checks out when I convert back.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polar coordinates are \\boxed{(3, \\dfrac{\\pi}{2})}.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the rectangular coordinates \\((0, 3)\\) to polar coordinates \\((r, \\theta)\\):\n\n1.

The double sum I need to handle is the sum from j=1 to infinity and k=1 to infinity of 1/(j + k)\u00b3. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that p is the Basel problem, which equals \u03c0\u00b2/6, and q is known as Apery's constant, approximately 1.202... But I don't think the exact values are necessary here; instead, I need to relate the double sum to p and q somehow.\n\nLet me write out the double sum:\n\nS = \u03a3_{j=1}^\u221e \u03a3_{k=1}^\u221e 1/(j + k)\u00b3.\n\nSo, for each j and k, we're adding 1 over (j + k) cubed. Maybe I can change variables to make this easier. Let me set n = j + k. Then, for each n, j can range from 1 to n - 1, since k would be n - j. So, perhaps I can rewrite the double sum as a single sum over n, where each term is the sum over j from 1 to n - 1 of 1/n\u00b3.\n\nWait, let me check that. If n = j + k, then for each fixed n, j can go from 1 to n - 1, and k would be n - j, which also goes from 1 to n - 1. So, for each n \u2265 2, the number of pairs (j, k) such that j + k = n is (n - 1). Therefore, the double sum can be rewritten as:\n\nS = \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3.\n\nIs that correct? Let me see: For n=2, j=1, k=1, so 1 term. For n=3, j=1,2 and k=2,1, so 2 terms. Yeah, so each n contributes (n - 1) terms each of 1/n\u00b3. So, S = \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3.\n\nOkay, so that's a good start. Now, let's see if I can express this as a combination of p and q. Let's write out the terms:\n\nS = \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3 = \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e (n/n\u00b3 - 1/n\u00b3) = \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e (1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3).\n\nSo, S = (\u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2) - (\u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3).\n\nBut p is \u03a3_{n=1}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2, so \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2 = p - 1.\n\nSimilarly, q is \u03a3_{n=1}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3, so \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3 = q - 1.\n\nTherefore, S = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q.\n\nWait, so S = p - q? That seems too straightforward. Let me verify.\n\nStarting again: S = \u03a3_{j=1}^\u221e \u03a3_{k=1}^\u221e 1/(j + k)\u00b3. Let n = j + k. Then, for each n, the number of (j, k) pairs is (n - 1), so S = \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3.\n\nBreaking it down, (n - 1)/n\u00b3 = n/n\u00b3 - 1/n\u00b3 = 1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3. So, S = \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e (1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3). Then, as p = \u03a3_{n=1}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2, so \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2 = p - 1. Similarly, \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3 = q - 1. So, S = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q. Hmm, that seems to check out.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that I'm missing something? Because sometimes in double sums, especially when changing variables, it's easy to make a mistake with indices or the number of terms.\n\nLet me consider n=2: j=1, k=1. So, 1/(1 + 1)\u00b3 = 1/8. So, that's 1 term, contributing 1/8.\n\nIn the expression S = \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3, for n=2, we have 1/8, which is correct.\n\nFor n=3: j=1,k=2 and j=2,k=1. Each term is 1/27, so 2*(1/27) = 2/27. In the expression, (3 - 1)/3\u00b3 = 2/27, which matches.\n\nSimilarly, n=4: j=1,k=3; j=2,k=2; j=3,k=1. Each term is 1/64, so 3*(1/64) = 3/64. From the expression, (4 - 1)/4\u00b3 = 3/64. So, that's correct too.\n\nOkay, so the change of variables seems correct, and the number of terms is properly accounted for. So, the expression S = \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e (1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3) is correct.\n\nTherefore, S = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q. So, S = p - q.\n\nWait, is that really all? Let me see if I can find another way to express S in terms of p and q, just to verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider the double sum as a convolution or something. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write S as \u03a3_{j=1}^\u221e \u03a3_{k=1}^\u221e 1/(j + k)\u00b3. Let me fix j and sum over k. For a fixed j, let m = k + j, so k = m - j. Then, when k=1, m = j + 1, and as k approaches infinity, m approaches infinity. So, for each j, the inner sum becomes \u03a3_{m=j + 1}^\u221e 1/m\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, S = \u03a3_{j=1}^\u221e \u03a3_{m=j + 1}^\u221e 1/m\u00b3.\n\nBut \u03a3_{m=j + 1}^\u221e 1/m\u00b3 = q - \u03a3_{m=1}^j 1/m\u00b3.\n\nSo, S = \u03a3_{j=1}^\u221e (q - \u03a3_{m=1}^j 1/m\u00b3).\n\nBut that seems more complicated. Let me see:\n\nS = \u03a3_{j=1}^\u221e q - \u03a3_{j=1}^\u221e \u03a3_{m=1}^j 1/m\u00b3.\n\nBut \u03a3_{j=1}^\u221e q is divergent because q is a constant, so summing it infinitely would go to infinity. That can't be right because S is convergent. So, perhaps this approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe swapping the order of summation. Let's see:\n\nS = \u03a3_{k=1}^\u221e \u03a3_{j=1}^\u221e 1/(j + k)\u00b3.\n\nSimilarly, for fixed k, let m = j + k, so j = m - k. Then, when j=1, m=k+1, and as j approaches infinity, m approaches infinity. So, the inner sum becomes \u03a3_{m=k + 1}^\u221e 1/m\u00b3, which is again q - \u03a3_{m=1}^k 1/m\u00b3.\n\nThus, S = \u03a3_{k=1}^\u221e (q - \u03a3_{m=1}^k 1/m\u00b3).\n\nBut again, this leads us to \u03a3_{k=1}^\u221e q - \u03a3_{k=1}^\u221e \u03a3_{m=1}^k 1/m\u00b3, which is divergent minus something, which isn't helpful. So, maybe this approach isn't useful.\n\nTherefore, going back, the first method seems correct, where we let n = j + k and found that S = p - q.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the first step.\n\nI rewrote the double sum as \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3, which is correct because for each n, there are (n - 1) pairs (j, k) such that j + k = n.\n\nThen, (n - 1)/n\u00b3 = 1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3, so S = \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e (1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3).\n\nWhich is equal to \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2 - \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3.\n\nSince p = \u03a3_{n=1}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2, then \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2 = p - 1.\n\nSimilarly, q = \u03a3_{n=1}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3, so \u03a3_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3 = q - 1.\n\nTherefore, S = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.\n\nYes, that seems consistent. So, I think that is the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, to double-check, let me compute S numerically for a few terms and see if it approximates p - q.\n\nLet's compute S up to, say, j and k up to 2:\n\nS \u2248 1/(1+1)^3 + 1/(1+2)^3 + 1/(2+1)^3 + 1/(2+2)^3 + ... up to j,k=2.\n\nWait, actually, it's a double sum, so for j=1, k=1: 1/8\n\nj=1, k=2: 1/27\n\nj=2, k=1: 1/27\n\nj=1, k=3: 1/64\n\nj=3, k=1: 1/64\n\nj=2, k=2: 1/64\n\nj=2, k=3: 1/125\n\nj=3, k=2: 1/125\n\nj=1, k=4: 1/125\n\nj=4, k=1: 1/125\n\nAnd so on. So, S is the sum of all these terms.\n\nBut computing S numerically would take a lot of terms to get a good approximation, and p - q is approximately (1.6449 - 1) - (1.20206 - 1) = 0.6449 - 0.20206 \u2248 0.4428.\n\nWait, actually, p = \u03c0\u00b2/6 \u2248 1.6449, q \u2248 1.20206, so p - q \u2248 0.4428.\n\nNow, let's compute partial sums of S:\n\nFirst few terms:\n\nj=1, k=1: 1/8 = 0.125\n\nj=1, k=2 and j=2, k=1: 2*(1/27) \u2248 0.07407\n\nj=1, k=3; j=3, k=1; j=2, k=2: 3*(1/64) \u2248 0.046875\n\nj=1, k=4; j=4, k=1; j=2, k=3; j=3, k=2: 4*(1/125) \u2248 0.032\n\nj=1, k=5; j=5, k=1; j=2, k=4; j=4, k=2; j=3, k=3: 5*(1/216) \u2248 0.02315\n\nAdding these up:\n\n0.125 + 0.07407 \u2248 0.19907\n\n+ 0.046875 \u2248 0.245945\n\n+ 0.032 \u2248 0.277945\n\n+ 0.02315 \u2248 0.301095\n\nContinuing:\n\nj=1, k=6; j=6, k=1; j=2, k=5; j=5, k=2; j=3, k=4; j=4, k=3: 6*(1/343) \u2248 6*0.002915 \u2248 0.01749\n\nAdding: \u2248 0.301095 + 0.01749 \u2248 0.318585\n\nNext term, n=7:\n\n7*(1/512) \u2248 7*0.001953 \u2248 0.01367\n\nTotal \u2248 0.318585 + 0.01367 \u2248 0.332255\n\nn=8: 8*(1/729) \u2248 8*0.001371 \u2248 0.01097\n\nTotal \u2248 0.332255 + 0.01097 \u2248 0.343225\n\nn=9: 9*(1/1000) = 0.009\n\nTotal \u2248 0.343225 + 0.009 \u2248 0.352225\n\nn=10: 10*(1/1331) \u2248 10*0.000751 \u2248 0.00751\n\nTotal \u2248 0.352225 + 0.00751 \u2248 0.359735\n\nSo, up to n=10, we have approximately 0.3597. The actual value of p - q is approximately 0.4428. So, we can see that the partial sums are approaching that value, though slowly. So, that gives me more confidence that S = p - q is correct.\n\nTherefore, after all these steps and verifications, I think the answer is S = p - q.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{p - q}\n</think>\n\nTo find a way to write the double sum\n\\[\n\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\n\\]\nin terms of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), where \\( p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} \\) and \\( q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3} \\), we start by changing variables.

Hmm, let's see. I think I should start by plugging each of these x-values into the function one by one and then adding the results together. \n\nFirst, let's find f(-2). That means I substitute x with -2 in the function. So, f(-2) = [3*(-2) - 2]/[(-2) - 2]. Let me calculate the numerator and denominator separately to avoid mistakes.\n\nNumerator: 3*(-2) is -6, and then subtract 2 gives me -6 - 2 = -8.\n\nDenominator: (-2) - 2 is -4.\n\nSo, f(-2) = (-8)/(-4) which simplifies to 2. Okay, that seems straightforward. \n\nNext, let's compute f(-1). Again, substitute x with -1. So, f(-1) = [3*(-1) - 2]/[(-1) - 2].\n\nCalculating numerator: 3*(-1) is -3, subtract 2 gives -3 - 2 = -5.\n\nDenominator: (-1) - 2 is -3.\n\nSo, f(-1) = (-5)/(-3). Hmm, that's a fraction. I can write this as 5/3 because a negative divided by a negative is positive. So, f(-1) is 5/3.\n\nNow, moving on to f(0). Substitute x with 0. So, f(0) = [3*(0) - 2]/[0 - 2].\n\nNumerator: 3*0 is 0, subtract 2 is -2.\n\nDenominator: 0 - 2 is -2.\n\nSo, f(0) = (-2)/(-2) which simplifies to 1. That makes sense because the negatives cancel out.\n\nAlright, so now I have f(-2) = 2, f(-1) = 5/3, and f(0) = 1. I need to add these three values together: 2 + 5/3 + 1.\n\nLet me add them step by step. First, 2 + 1 is 3. Then, I have 3 + 5/3. Hmm, to add these, I can express 3 as a fraction with denominator 3. So, 3 is the same as 9/3. Therefore, 9/3 + 5/3 = (9 + 5)/3 = 14/3.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with f(-2): [3*(-2) - 2] = (-6 - 2) = -8. Denominator: (-2 - 2) = -4. -8/-4 = 2. That's correct.\n\nf(-1): [3*(-1) - 2] = (-3 - 2) = -5. Denominator: (-1 - 2) = -3. -5/-3 = 5/3. That's right.\n\nf(0): [3*0 - 2] = -2. Denominator: 0 - 2 = -2. -2/-2 = 1. Correct.\n\nAdding them: 2 + 5/3 + 1. 2 + 1 is 3, and 3 is 9/3. So, 9/3 + 5/3 = 14/3. Hmm, 14/3 is equal to 4 and 2/3. Is that possible? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can add them differently to confirm. Let's convert all to fractions:\n\n2 is 2/1, 5/3 is already a fraction, and 1 is 1/1. To add them, I need a common denominator, which would be 3.\n\nSo, 2/1 is 6/3, 5/3 stays the same, and 1/1 is 3/3. So, adding them together: 6/3 + 5/3 + 3/3 = (6 + 5 + 3)/3 = 14/3. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, 14/3 is the sum. I think that's the correct answer. Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the function substitution:\n\nf(x) = (3x - 2)/(x - 2). So, for each x, I substituted correctly. Let me check f(-1) again:\n\n3*(-1) is -3, minus 2 is -5. Denominator: -1 minus 2 is -3. So, -5/-3 is 5/3. Correct.\n\nAlright, I feel confident that the sum is 14/3. \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) where the function is given as \\( f(x) = \\frac{3x - 2}{x - 2} \\), we start by evaluating the function at each of the given points.\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( f(-2) \\):\n\\[\nf(-2) = \\frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \\frac{-6 - 2}{-4} = \\frac{-8}{-4} = 2\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( f(-1) \\):\n\\[\nf(-1) = \\frac{3(-1) - 2}{-1 - 2} = \\frac{-3 - 2}{-3} = \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3}\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate \\( f(0) \\):\n\\[\nf(0) = \\frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} = \\frac{-2}{-2} = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, we add the results together:\n\\[\nf(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + \\frac{5}{3} + 1\n\\]\n\nConverting all terms to a common denominator (3) for addition:\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{6}{3}, \\quad 1 = \\frac{3}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{3} + \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{6 + 5 + 3}{3} = \\frac{14}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}.", "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has. Hmm, divisors are numbers that divide 196 without leaving any remainder. I remember that to find the number of divisors, it's helpful to look at the prime factorization of the number. Once I have that, there's a formula involving adding one to each of the exponents and then multiplying them together. Let me try to recall the exact steps.\n\nFirst, let me start by finding the prime factors of 196. I know that 196 is an even number because it ends with a 6, so it's divisible by 2. Let me divide 196 by 2.\n\n196 \u00f7 2 = 98.\n\nAlright, so 2 is a prime factor, and now I have 98 left. 98 is still even, so I can divide by 2 again.\n\n98 \u00f7 2 = 49.\n\nOkay, so now I have 49. 49 is not even, so I can't divide by 2 anymore. Let me think about the next prime number. 3 doesn't divide into 49 because 49 \u00f7 3 is about 16.333, which isn't a whole number. The next prime is 5, but 49 \u00f7 5 is 9.8, which isn't a whole number either. Hmm, the next prime is 7. Let me try that.\n\n49 \u00f7 7 = 7.\n\nPerfect! So 7 is another prime factor, and now I have 7 left. Dividing 7 by 7 gives me 1.\n\n7 \u00f7 7 = 1.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the prime factors of 196 are 2, 2, 7, and 7. In exponent form, that would be 2 squared times 7 squared, right? So, 196 = 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2.\n\nNow, I remember the formula for finding the number of divisors. If a number N can be expressed as the product of primes raised to their respective exponents, like N = p\u2081^a \u00d7 p\u2082^b \u00d7 ... \u00d7 p\u2099^k, then the number of positive divisors is (a+1)(b+1)...(k+1). Each exponent is increased by one and then multiplied together.\n\nApplying that to 196, which is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2, the exponents are both 2. So, for each prime factor, we add one to the exponent and multiply them. That would be (2+1) \u00d7 (2+1). Let me calculate that.\n\n(2+1) = 3\n(2+1) = 3\n3 \u00d7 3 = 9\n\nSo, does that mean 196 has 9 positive divisors? Let me list them out to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 1 and 196 because 1 times 196 is 196. Then, 2 and 98 because 2 times 98 is 196. Next, 4 and 49 because 4 times 49 is 196. Then, 7 and 28 because 7 times 28 is 196. Finally, 14 and 14 because 14 times 14 is 196.\n\nWait, let me count them: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. That's 9 divisors. Hmm, seems right. But let me double-check if I missed any or counted extra.\n\nStarting from 1: 1 is a divisor.\nThen 2: 196 \u00f7 2 = 98, which is a whole number.\nNext, 4: 196 \u00f7 4 = 49, which is a whole number.\n7: 196 \u00f7 7 = 28, which is a whole number.\n14: 196 \u00f7 14 = 14, which is a whole number.\n28: 196 \u00f7 28 = 7, which we've already counted.\n49: 196 \u00f7 49 = 4, which we've already counted.\n98: 196 \u00f7 98 = 2, which we've already counted.\n196: 196 \u00f7 196 = 1, which we've already counted.\n\nSo, the unique divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, and 196. That's 9 divisors in total. So, my initial calculation using the formula was correct. It's always good to verify by listing them out to ensure there are no mistakes.\n\nWait a second, just to make sure, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the concept of factors in pairs. Each divisor less than the square root of the number pairs with a divisor greater than the square root. So, the square root of 196 is 14. That means the factors less than 14 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. But wait, 14 is the square root, so it's paired with itself. So, the number of factors less than the square root is 4 (excluding 14), and each of these pairs with a corresponding factor greater than the square root. So, 4 pairs make 8 factors, and then adding the square root itself, which is 14, gives us 9 factors in total. Yep, that also makes sense.\n\nSo, both methods\u2014the formula and pairing the factors\u2014lead me to the same conclusion: 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n\nI think I'm confident with this answer now. It's always a bit nerve-wracking when you're dealing with exponents and divisors, but going through the steps methodically and verifying with another approach helps solidify the understanding.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Find the prime factors of 196: 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2.\n2. Apply the formula: (2+1)(2+1) = 3\u00d73 = 9.\n3. Verify by listing all divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196.\n4. Alternatively, use the square root method: square root of 196 is 14, which is a factor, and the number of pairs below 14 is 4, leading to 8 factors, plus 14 itself, totaling 9.\n\nAll methods point to the same answer, so I think I can be certain that 196 has 9 positive divisors.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, we start by finding its prime factorization. \n\n196 is an even number, so we divide by 2:\n\\[ 196 \\div 2 = 98 \\]\n98 is also even, so we divide by 2 again:\n\\[ 98 \\div 2 = 49 \\]\n49 is not even, so we try the next prime number, which is 7:\n\\[ 49 \\div 7 = 7 \\]\n7 is a prime number, so we divide by 7:\n\\[ 7 \\div 7 = 1 \\]\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n\\[ 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\]\n\nUsing the formula for the number of divisors, if a number \\( N \\) can be expressed as \\( N = p_1^a \\times p_2^b \\times \\ldots \\times p_n^k \\), then the number of positive divisors is given by:\n\\[ (a+1)(b+1)\\ldots(k+1) \\]\n\nFor 196, the exponents are 2 and 2. Therefore, the number of divisors is:\n\\[ (2+1)(2+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\nTo verify, we list the divisors of 196: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Counting these, we find there are 9 divisors.\n\nThus, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."]
