["Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to convert the rectangular coordinates (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, \u03b8), where r is the distance from the origin and \u03b8 is the angle made with the positive x-axis. But I need to recall exactly how to calculate r and \u03b8 from the given rectangular coordinates.\n\nFirst, let me jot down the formulas I think are relevant. I believe the conversion from rectangular (x, y) to polar (r, \u03b8) involves two main equations:\n\n1. \\( r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\)\n2. \\( \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) \\)\n\nBut wait, I think the second formula might need some adjustment because the arctangent function can sometimes give the wrong angle depending on the quadrant where the point is located. Since in this case, the point is (0, 3), which is on the positive y-axis, I should consider that when calculating \u03b8.\n\nLet me start by calculating r. Given x = 0 and y = 3, plugging into the first formula:\n\n\\( r = \\sqrt{(0)^2 + (3)^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 9} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\)\n\nOkay, that seems straightforward. So r is 3. That makes sense because the point is 3 units away from the origin on the y-axis.\n\nNow, moving on to \u03b8. Using the second formula:\n\n\\( \\theta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) \\)\n\nBut wait, if x is 0, then we're dividing by zero, which is undefined. Hmm, that means I can't use that formula directly here. I need another way to find \u03b8.\n\nI remember that when x is 0, the point lies either on the positive y-axis or the negative y-axis. In this case, y is positive, so the point is on the positive y-axis. From the unit circle, I recall that the angle corresponding to the positive y-axis is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) radians or 90 degrees.\n\nLet me confirm that. If I consider the standard position of an angle in polar coordinates, starting from the positive x-axis and rotating counterclockwise. When I rotate 90 degrees, I reach the positive y-axis, which aligns with the point (0, 3). So \u03b8 should indeed be \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\).\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the tangent function, which is sine over cosine. If x is 0, then cosine of \u03b8 is 0, which happens at \u03b8 = \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) and \u03b8 = \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\). But since y is positive, \u03b8 must be \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), not \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\), because \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\) is on the negative y-axis.\n\nJust to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me visualize the coordinate system. The point (0, 3) is straight up on the y-axis, three units above the origin. So, in polar coordinates, we want a radius of 3 and an angle that points directly upwards. Since angles in polar coordinates start from the positive x-axis and go counterclockwise, 90 degrees or \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) radians is the correct angle.\n\nI think that's it. So, putting it all together, the polar coordinates should be (3, \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\)).\n\nWait, just to double-check, let me consider another approach. Sometimes, when converting from rectangular to polar, you can also use the cosine and sine functions. Specifically:\n\n- \\( r \\cos \\theta = x \\)\n- \\( r \\sin \\theta = y \\)\n\nGiven that, for the point (0, 3):\n\n- \\( 3 \\cos \\theta = 0 \\)\n- \\( 3 \\sin \\theta = 3 \\)\n\nFrom the first equation, \\( 3 \\cos \\theta = 0 \\) implies \\( \\cos \\theta = 0 \\). The solutions to this are \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) and \\( \\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\).\n\nFrom the second equation, \\( 3 \\sin \\theta = 3 \\) simplifies to \\( \\sin \\theta = 1 \\). The solution to this is \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\).\n\nSo, the only angle that satisfies both equations is \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\). That confirms my earlier conclusion.\n\nAnother way to think about it is considering the direction of the point. Since x is 0, the point is purely along the y-axis. Since y is positive, it's in the upper half, so the angle is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\). If y were negative, it would be \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\).\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing any edge cases, let me recall that when x is 0, the point is either at the top or bottom of the coordinate system, so those correspond to \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) and \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\). Since y is positive, it's the top, so \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) is correct.\n\nI also remember that in polar coordinates, \u03b8 is measured from the positive x-axis, so moving counterclockwise, 0 radians is along the positive x-axis, \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) is up along the y-axis, \\( \\pi \\) is to the left along the negative x-axis, and \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\) is down along the negative y-axis.\n\nTherefore, since our point is on the positive y-axis, \u03b8 is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\), and r is 3.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n- Calculated r using \\( \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\), got 3.\n- Tried to calculate \u03b8 using arctangent, realized x is 0, so arctangent is undefined.\n- Remembered that when x is 0, \u03b8 is either \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) or \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\).\n- Since y is positive, \u03b8 is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\).\n- Double-checked using sine and cosine relationships, confirming \u03b8 is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\).\n- Visualized the point on the coordinate system to ensure it makes sense.\n\nI think that's thorough enough. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, the polar coordinates are (3, \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\)).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polar coordinates are \\boxed{\\left(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)}.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the rectangular coordinates \\((0, 3)\\) to polar coordinates \\((r, \\theta)\\):\n\n1. Calculate \\(r\\) using the formula \\( r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine \\(\\theta\\) since the point \\((0, 3)\\) lies on the positive y-axis. The angle corresponding to the positive y-axis is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) radians.\n\n3. Confirm using the relationships \\( r \\cos \\theta = x \\) and \\( r \\sin \\theta = y \\):\n   - \\( 3 \\cos \\theta = 0 \\) implies \\( \\cos \\theta = 0 \\), which gives \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\) or \\( \\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\).\n   - \\( 3 \\sin \\theta = 3 \\) implies \\( \\sin \\theta = 1 \\), which gives \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\).\n\nThus, the polar coordinates are \\(\\boxed{\\left(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)}\\).", "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>Define\n\\[p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}.\\]Find a way to write\n\\[\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\]in terms of $p$ and $q.$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to express the double sum \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\) in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), where \\(p\\) is the sum of reciprocals of squares and \\(q\\) is the sum of reciprocals of cubes. That is,\n\n\\[\np = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad q = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}.\n\\]\n\nI know that \\(p\\) is a well-known series; in fact, it's equal to \\(\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\), and \\(q\\) is the Riemann zeta function at 3, which doesn't have a simple closed-form expression but is a known constant.\n\nSo, my goal is to manipulate the double sum so that I can express it using \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the double sum is over all positive integers \\(j\\) and \\(k\\). Each term is \\(\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\). Hmm, so for each pair \\((j, k)\\), we're taking the reciprocal of the cube of their sum.\n\nI wonder if I can change variables to simplify this expression. Maybe instead of summing over \\(j\\) and \\(k\\), I can sum over \\(n = j + k\\) and some other variable. That might help because the denominator is \\((j + k)^3\\), so if I fix \\(n = j + k\\), then each term becomes \\(\\frac{1}{n^3}\\), and I can sum over \\(n\\).\n\nLet me try that. Let me set \\(n = j + k\\). Then, for each fixed \\(n\\), \\(j\\) can range from 1 to \\(n - 1\\), because \\(k\\) has to be at least 1. So, for each \\(n\\), the number of pairs \\((j, k)\\) such that \\(j + k = n\\) is \\(n - 1\\). Therefore, the original double sum can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{n^3} = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3} \\right).\n\\]\n\nWait, let me check that step. If I have \\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{n^3}\\), that's equal to \\((n - 1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{n^3}\\), which is \\(\\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\\). Then, I can split that fraction into two parts:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \\frac{n}{n^3} - \\frac{1}{n^3} = \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3}.\n\\]\n\nSo, yes, that seems correct. So, now, the double sum becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3} \\right) = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}.\n\\]\n\nNow, I can express these sums in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Let's note that:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} = p - \\frac{1}{1^2} = p - 1,\n\\]\nsince \\(p\\) starts at \\(n=1\\), and we're subtracting the \\(n=1\\) term.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} = q - \\frac{1}{1^3} = q - 1.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, substituting these back into the expression, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q.\n\\]\n\nWait, so does that mean the original double sum is equal to \\(p - q\\)?\n\nLet me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. I started with the double sum \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\).\n2. I set \\(n = j + k\\), so for each \\(n \\geq 2\\), the inner sum is over \\(j = 1\\) to \\(n - 1\\).\n3. The inner sum becomes \\((n - 1) \\cdot \\frac{1}{n^3}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3}\\).\n4. Then, the double sum becomes \\(\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3} \\right)\\).\n5. I expressed this as \\((p - 1) - (q - 1)\\), which simplifies to \\(p - q\\).\n\nHmm, that seems correct. So, the double sum is equal to \\(p - q\\).\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think of another approach. Maybe using generating functions or known series identities.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of the double sum as a convolution. Let me recall that sometimes double sums can be related to the convolution of two series.\n\nIn general, for two sequences \\(a_j\\) and \\(b_k\\), the double sum \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty a_j b_k\\) can sometimes be expressed in terms of the product of their generating functions. However, in this case, the term is \\(\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\), which is similar to a convolution.\n\nBut in this case, it's a double sum over \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) of \\(1/(j + k)^3\\). So, maybe we can express this as a convolution.\n\nWait, but I think my first approach was more straightforward. Changing variables to \\(n = j + k\\) simplifies the expression, and that led me to \\(p - q\\).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the double sum numerically for a few terms and see if it aligns with \\(p - q\\). Let's compute both sides approximately.\n\nWe know that \\(p = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k^2 \\approx 1.6449\\) (since \\(\\pi^2/6 \\approx 1.6449\\)), and \\(q = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k^3 \\approx 1.2020569\\). So, \\(p - q \\approx 1.6449 - 1.2020569 \\approx 0.44284\\).\n\nNow, let's approximate the double sum \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(j + k)^3\\). Let's compute the first few terms:\n\nFor \\(j=1, k=1\\): \\(1/8 = 0.125\\)\n\n\\(j=1, k=2\\): \\(1/27 \\approx 0.037037\\)\n\n\\(j=2, k=1\\): same as above, 0.037037\n\n\\(j=1, k=3\\): \\(1/64 \\approx 0.015625\\)\n\n\\(j=3, k=1\\): same, 0.015625\n\n\\(j=2, k=2\\): \\(1/64 \\approx 0.015625\\)\n\n\\(j=1, k=4\\): \\(1/125 = 0.008\\)\n\n\\(j=4, k=1\\): same, 0.008\n\n\\(j=2, k=3\\): \\(1/125 = 0.008\\)\n\n\\(j=3, k=2\\): same, 0.008\n\n\\(j=2, k=4\\): \\(1/216 \\approx 0.00463\\)\n\n\\(j=4, k=2\\): same, 0.00463\n\nAnd so on. Let's add these up:\n\nFirst term: 0.125\n\nNext two: 0.037037 + 0.037037 \u2248 0.074074, total so far: ~0.2\n\nNext four terms: 0.015625 + 0.015625 + 0.015625 + 0.015625 \u2248 0.0625, total: ~0.2625\n\nNext four terms: 0.008 * 4 = 0.032, total: ~0.2945\n\nNext four terms: 0.00463 * 4 \u2248 0.01852, total: ~0.313\n\nContinuing this, each layer adds less. So, it's clear that the sum converges, but how much is it?\n\nIf we take the first few layers, we already have approximately 0.313. The total sum is supposed to be around 0.4428 according to \\(p - q\\). So, it seems plausible that the sum is around 0.44, as my approximation suggests.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about generating functions. The generating function for \\(1/n^3\\) is related to the Dirichlet generating function. But I might not need that here since the first method worked.\n\nWait, but let me see if I can think differently. Suppose I fix \\(j\\) and sum over \\(k\\). Then, for each fixed \\(j\\), the inner sum is \\(\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\). Let me make a substitution: let \\(m = j + k\\). Then, when \\(k = 1\\), \\(m = j + 1\\), and as \\(k\\) approaches infinity, \\(m\\) approaches infinity. So, the inner sum becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{m = j + 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} = \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m^3} - \\sum_{m=1}^j \\frac{1}{m^3} = q - \\sum_{m=1}^j \\frac{1}{m^3}.\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the original double sum is equal to:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\left( q - \\sum_{m=1}^j \\frac{1}{m^3} \\right) = q \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty 1 - \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{m=1}^j \\frac{1}{m^3}.\n\\]\n\nBut wait, \\(q \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty 1\\) is divergent because it's \\(q\\) times infinity, which doesn't make sense. So, this approach seems problematic because it leads to a divergence, which is not helpful. Therefore, maybe this substitution isn't the right way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider swapping the order of summation or using integral representations.\n\nWait, perhaps I can express \\(1/(j + k)^3\\) as an integral. Remember that for positive integers, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\int_0^1 x^{j + k - 1} dx \\int_0^1 y^{j + k - 1} dy \\quad \\text{or something similar}?\n\\]\n\nWait, not exactly. Alternatively, I know that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n^3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^1 x^{n - 1} (-\\ln x)^2 dx,\n\\]\n\nbut I'm not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the integral representation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{n^3} = \\int_0^1 x^{n - 1} dx \\cdot \\int_0^1 y^{n - 1} dy \\cdot \\int_0^1 z^{n - 1} dz,\n\\]\n\nbut this might complicate things further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the fact that:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{(n - 1)}{n^3} = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3},\n\\]\n\nwhich is exactly what I did before, leading to \\(p - q\\). So, perhaps that's the simplest way.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me think about another approach.\n\nSuppose I consider the generating function \\(G(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty x^{j + k}\\). Then, the double sum is \\(G'''(0)\\), because the third derivative would bring down a factor of \\((j + k)^3\\). But this might be more complicated.\n\nWait, let me think. If \\(G(x) = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty x^{j + k} = \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty x^j \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty x^k \\right) = \\left( \\frac{x}{1 - x} \\right)^2\\).\n\nThen, the first derivative \\(G'(x)\\) would be \\(2 \\cdot \\frac{x(1 - x) + x^2}{(1 - x)^4} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{x}{(1 - x)^3}\\).\n\nWait, let me compute \\(G'(x)\\):\n\n\\(G(x) = \\left( \\frac{x}{1 - x} \\right)^2\\).\n\nSo, \\(G'(x) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{x}{1 - x} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2} = \\frac{2x}{(1 - x)^3}\\).\n\nSimilarly, the second derivative:\n\n\\(G''(x) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{(1 - x)^3 \\cdot 1 - x \\cdot 3(1 - x)^2 (-1)}{(1 - x)^6}\\).\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, \\(G'(x) = \\frac{2x}{(1 - x)^3}\\).\n\nThen, \\(G''(x)\\) is the derivative of that:\n\nUsing the quotient rule, derivative of numerator \\(2x\\) is 2, and derivative of denominator \\((1 - x)^3\\) is \\(-3(1 - x)^2\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nG''(x) = \\frac{2 \\cdot (1 - x)^3 - 2x \\cdot (-3)(1 - x)^2}{(1 - x)^6} = \\frac{2(1 - x)^3 + 6x(1 - x)^2}{(1 - x)^6}.\n\\]\n\nFactor out \\(2(1 - x)^2\\):\n\n\\[\n= \\frac{2(1 - x) + 6x}{(1 - x)^4} = \\frac{2 - 2x + 6x}{(1 - x)^4} = \\frac{2 + 4x}{(1 - x)^4}.\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the third derivative \\(G'''(x)\\) would be:\n\nDerivative of numerator: \\(4\\), and derivative of denominator: \\(-4(1 - x)^3\\).\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nG'''(x) = \\frac{4 \\cdot (1 - x)^4 - (2 + 4x) \\cdot (-4)(1 - x)^3}{(1 - x)^8}.\n\\]\n\nWait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express \\(G'''(0)\\) directly.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is overcomplicating things, since I already have an expression in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). So, maybe I should stick with my first method.\n\nWait, but let's see if \\(G'''(0)\\) relates to our double sum.\n\nNote that:\n\n\\[\nG(x) = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty (n - 1) x^n,\n\\]\n\nsince the double sum \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty x^{j + k} = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty (n - 1) x^n\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(G(x)\\) is the generating function for the sequence \\(a_n = n - 1\\) starting at \\(n=2\\).\n\nThen, the generating function for \\(a_n\\) is \\(G(x)\\), so the generating function for \\(a_n / n^3\\) would be related to integrating \\(G(x)\\) three times, but I think that's more involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express \\(G(x)\\) as \\(\\frac{x}{(1 - x)^2}\\), as I had earlier, and then relate its derivatives to the sums.\n\nBut, honestly, this seems more complicated than my initial approach, so maybe I can just accept that \\(p - q\\) is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but let me just think again: \\(p = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n^2\\), so \\(\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty 1/n^2 = p - 1\\), and similarly, \\(\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty 1/n^3 = q - 1\\). Therefore, subtracting these, I get:\n\n\\[\n(p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.\n\\]\n\nYes, that seems consistent. Therefore, the double sum is equal to \\(p - q\\).\n\nAlternatively, just to make sure, let me compute \\(p - q\\) numerically and compare it with the approximate value of the double sum.\n\nAs I mentioned, \\(p \\approx 1.6449\\) and \\(q \\approx 1.2020569\\), so \\(p - q \\approx 0.44284\\).\n\nEarlier, when I computed the first few terms of the double sum, I got approximately 0.313. The actual sum converges to about 0.4428, which is exactly \\(p - q\\). So, that seems to confirm that the expression is correct.\n\nTherefore, after all these steps and verifications, I can conclude that:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} = p - q.\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{p - q}\n</think>\n\nTo express the double sum \\(\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\) in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), where \\(p = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}\\) and \\(q = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}\\), we start by changing variables.

Express your answer as a common fraction.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this function f(x) = (3x - 2)/(x - 2), and I need to find the sum of f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0). Hmm, that doesn't look too bad, but I should take it step by step to make sure I don't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I think I should calculate each function value separately and then add them up. That seems logical. Let me start with f(-2). To find f(-2), I substitute x with -2 in the function.\n\nSo, f(-2) = (3*(-2) - 2)/(-2 - 2). Let me compute the numerator and the denominator separately.\n\nNumerator: 3*(-2) is -6, and then minus 2 is -8.\n\nDenominator: -2 minus 2 is -4.\n\nSo, f(-2) = (-8)/(-4). Dividing two negatives should give a positive, so that would be 2. Okay, so f(-2) is 2. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, I need to find f(-1). Again, substituting x with -1.\n\nf(-1) = (3*(-1) - 2)/(-1 - 2).\n\nCompute numerator: 3*(-1) is -3, minus 2 is -5.\n\nDenominator: -1 - 2 is -3.\n\nSo, f(-1) = (-5)/(-3). Dividing two negatives gives a positive, so that simplifies to 5/3. Hmm, 5/3 is a fraction, which is fine. So f(-1) is 5/3.\n\nNow, onto f(0). Substitute x with 0.\n\nf(0) = (3*0 - 2)/(0 - 2).\n\nCompute numerator: 3*0 is 0, minus 2 is -2.\n\nDenominator: 0 minus 2 is -2.\n\nSo, f(0) = (-2)/(-2). That simplifies to 1. Cool, so f(0) is 1.\n\nNow, I have all three function values: f(-2) = 2, f(-1) = 5/3, and f(0) = 1.\n\nI need to add them together: 2 + 5/3 + 1.\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, 2 + 1 is 3. Then, 3 + 5/3.\n\nTo add 3 and 5/3, it's easier if I express 3 as a fraction with denominator 3. So, 3 is equal to 9/3.\n\nTherefore, 9/3 + 5/3 = (9 + 5)/3 = 14/3.\n\nSo, the total sum is 14/3. Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with f(-2):\n\n(3*(-2) - 2)/( -2 - 2) = (-6 - 2)/(-4) = (-8)/(-4) = 2. That's correct.\n\nf(-1):\n\n(3*(-1) - 2)/( -1 - 2) = (-3 - 2)/(-3) = (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. That's right.\n\nf(0):\n\n(3*0 - 2)/(0 - 2) = (-2)/(-2) = 1. Correct.\n\nAdding them up: 2 + 5/3 + 1 = (2 + 1) + 5/3 = 3 + 5/3. Convert 3 to 9/3, so 9/3 + 5/3 = 14/3. Yep, that looks good.\n\nI think that's the answer then. 14/3. Let me just write it as a common fraction, which is already done.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) for the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{3x - 2}{x - 2} \\), we calculate each function value separately and then sum them up.\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( f(-2) \\):\n\\[\nf(-2) = \\frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \\frac{-6 - 2}{-4} = \\frac{-8}{-4} = 2\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( f(-1) \\):\n\\[\nf(-1) = \\frac{3(-1) - 2}{-1 - 2} = \\frac{-3 - 2}{-3} = \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3}\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate \\( f(0) \\):\n\\[\nf(0) = \\frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} = \\frac{-2}{-2} = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, we sum the values:\n\\[\nf(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + \\frac{5}{3} + 1\n\\]\n\nConvert 2 and 1 to fractions with a common denominator:\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{6}{3}, \\quad 1 = \\frac{3}{3}\n\\]\n\nAdd the fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{3} + \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{6 + 5 + 3}{3} = \\frac{14}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}\\).", "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I have this math problem: \"How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?\" Hmm, okay. I need to figure out all the numbers that can divide 196 without leaving a remainder. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that finding the number of divisors of a number can be done by looking at its prime factorization. Once you have the prime factors, there's a formula you can use to calculate the total number of divisors. Let me recall that formula. I think it's something like taking the exponents of the prime factors, adding one to each of them, and then multiplying those together. Yeah, that sounds right.\n\nSo, step one: find the prime factorization of 196. Okay, let's start breaking down 196. I know that 196 is an even number because it ends with a 6, so it's divisible by 2. Let me divide it by 2 first.\n\n196 \u00f7 2 = 98. Okay, so 2 is a prime factor, and now we have 98 left. 98 is also even, so we can divide by 2 again.\n\n98 \u00f7 2 = 49. Alright, so now we have 49. Hmm, 49 is a number I recognize as a square number. It's 7 multiplied by 7, right? So, 49 \u00f7 7 = 7, and then 7 \u00f7 7 = 1. So, that's as far as we can go with the prime factors.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\n196 = 2 \u00d7 98  \n98 = 2 \u00d7 49  \n49 = 7 \u00d7 7  \n7 = 7 \u00d7 1\n\nSo, putting it all together, the prime factors of 196 are 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 7 \u00d7 7. In exponent form, that would be 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2. Got it.\n\nNow, applying that formula I remembered earlier. If a number's prime factorization is p\u2081^a \u00d7 p\u2082^b \u00d7 ... \u00d7 p\u2099^k, then the number of divisors is (a+1)(b+1)...(k+1). Let me make sure I got that right. Each exponent is increased by one and then multiplied together. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, for 196, which is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2, the exponents are 2 and 2. Adding one to each gives us 3 and 3. Then, multiplying those together: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9. So, does that mean 196 has 9 positive divisors? Let me verify that.\n\nTo double-check, maybe I should list out all the divisors of 196 and count them. That way, I can make sure I didn't make a mistake with the formula.\n\nStarting from 1, since 1 is a divisor of every number. Then 2, because 196 is even. Then 4, because it's divisible by 4 (196 \u00f7 4 = 49). Next, 7, because 49 is 7 squared, so 7 is a factor. Then, 14, since 14 \u00d7 14 = 196? Wait, no, 14 \u00d7 14 is 196? Let me check: 14 \u00d7 14 is 196, yes, because 10 \u00d7 14 = 140 and 4 \u00d7 14 = 56; 140 + 56 = 196. So, 14 is also a divisor.\n\nThen, 28: 28 \u00d7 7 = 196. Let me verify that: 28 \u00d7 7 is 196, yes. Next, 49: 49 \u00d7 4 = 196, so that's a divisor. Then, 98: 98 \u00d7 2 = 196, so that's another. And finally, 196 itself is a divisor.\n\nWait, let me list them out in order to make sure I don't miss any:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196.\n\nThat's nine numbers. So, counting them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Yep, nine divisors. So that matches the result I got using the formula.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't skip any, let me think. Between 1 and 196, the possible divisors are numbers that can multiply another integer to get 196. So, starting from 1, then 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Hmm, I don't think I missed any. For example, 3 doesn't divide 196 because 196 \u00f7 3 is about 65.333, which isn't a whole number. 5 doesn't divide it because it doesn't end with a 0 or 5. 6? 196 \u00f7 6 is about 32.666, nope. 8? 196 \u00f7 8 is 24.5, not a whole number. 9? 196 \u00f7 9 is around 21.777, nope. 10? 196 \u00f7 10 is 19.6, which isn't whole. So, yeah, I think I have all the divisors.\n\nTherefore, using both the prime factorization method and the manual listing method, I arrived at 9 divisors. So, I think that's the correct answer.\n\nBut just to be thorough, let me recap the steps:\n\n1. Factorize 196 into primes: 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2.\n2. Use the formula for number of divisors: (2+1)(2+1) = 3\u00d73 = 9.\n3. Verified by listing all divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Counted them as 9.\n\nSeems solid. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, yeah, I'm confident that 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, we start by finding its prime factorization. \n\n196 is an even number, so we divide by 2:\n\\[ 196 \\div 2 = 98 \\]\n98 is also even, so we divide by 2 again:\n\\[ 98 \\div 2 = 49 \\]\n49 is a square number, so we divide by 7:\n\\[ 49 \\div 7 = 7 \\]\n7 is a prime number, so we divide by 7:\n\\[ 7 \\div 7 = 1 \\]\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n\\[ 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\]\n\nUsing the formula for the number of divisors, which is \\((a+1)(b+1)\\) for a number \\(n = p_1^a \\times p_2^b\\), we get:\n\\[ (2+1)(2+1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\nTo verify, we list all the divisors of 196:\n\\[ 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196 \\]\n\nThere are 9 divisors in total.\n\nThus, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."]
