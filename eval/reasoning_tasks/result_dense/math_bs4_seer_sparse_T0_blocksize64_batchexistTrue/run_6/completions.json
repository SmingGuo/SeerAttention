Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to convert the rectangular coordinates (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, okay. I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, \u03b8), where r is the distance from the origin and \u03b8 is the angle made with the positive x-axis. But let me think about how to get there step by step.\n\nFirst, I recall the formulas for converting from rectangular (x, y) to polar (r, \u03b8). I think the formula for r is something like the square root of (x squared plus y squared). So, in equation form, that would be:\n\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nOkay, so given the point (0, 3), let me plug those values into the formula. Here, x is 0 and y is 3. So, substituting those in:\n\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3\n\nAlright, so that gives me r = 3. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, onto finding \u03b8, the angle. I remember that \u03b8 is calculated using the arctangent function, specifically \u03b8 = arctan(y / x). But wait, in this case, x is 0, so y / x would be undefined. Hmm, division by zero is undefined, so I need to think about what that means in terms of the angle.\n\nLet me recall the unit circle. When x is 0, the point lies somewhere along the y-axis. Since y is positive (3 in this case), the point is on the positive y-axis. On the unit circle, the positive y-axis corresponds to an angle of \u03c0/2 radians, which is 90 degrees. So, \u03b8 should be \u03c0/2.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. So, in the first quadrant, when x is positive and y is positive, \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2. But in this case, x is 0, so it's exactly on the y-axis. So, in the unit circle, the angle is measured from the positive x-axis, and when you're on the positive y-axis, you've rotated \u03c0/2 radians from the positive x-axis. That makes sense.\n\nJust to double-check, if I think about the point (0, 3), it's straight up on the y-axis, three units away from the origin. So, in polar coordinates, it should be 3 units out from the origin at an angle of \u03c0/2. That seems right.\n\nLet me think if there's another way to calculate \u03b8 when x is 0. Since \u03b8 is arctan(y / x), and x is 0, we can consider the limit as x approaches 0. If x approaches 0 from the positive side, y / x approaches positive infinity, so arctan of positive infinity is \u03c0/2. Similarly, if x approaches 0 from the negative side, y / x approaches negative infinity, and arctan of negative infinity is -\u03c0/2. But in our case, x is exactly 0, and y is positive, so \u03b8 is \u03c0/2, not negative. So, that aligns with our previous conclusion.\n\nIs there a different formula I can use to confirm \u03b8? Maybe using sine or cosine? I know that in polar coordinates, x = r cos \u03b8 and y = r sin \u03b8. So, if I use these equations:\n\nx = r cos \u03b8\ny = r sin \u03b8\n\nGiven that x is 0 and y is 3, and r is 3, we can plug in:\n\n0 = 3 cos \u03b8\n3 = 3 sin \u03b8\n\nDividing both equations by 3:\n\n0 = cos \u03b8\n1 = sin \u03b8\n\nSo, cos \u03b8 is 0 when \u03b8 is \u03c0/2 or 3\u03c0/2, and sin \u03b8 is 1 when \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. Therefore, \u03b8 must be \u03c0/2. That's consistent with what I thought earlier.\n\nLet me also visualize this. If I plot the point (0, 3) on the Cartesian plane, it's on the positive y-axis. So, if I were to draw a line from the origin to this point, it would form a right angle with the x-axis. That right angle is \u03c0/2 radians. So, that solidifies my understanding.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using the direction from the origin to the point. Since we're on the positive y-axis, the direction is straight up, which is 90 degrees or \u03c0/2 radians. So, that's another confirmation.\n\nWait, could there be another angle that results in the same point? I know that in polar coordinates, adding 2\u03c0 to \u03b8 would result in the same point, but since \u03b8 is restricted to be between 0 and 2\u03c0, \u03c0/2 is the only angle in that interval that satisfies the condition. Similarly, negative angles could also represent the same direction, but since we need \u03b8 to be non-negative and less than 2\u03c0, \u03c0/2 is the appropriate choice.\n\nI think I've covered all the bases here. Calculated r, considered the undefined arctangent, checked with the unit circle, used the definitions of sine and cosine in polar coordinates, and even thought about the geometric interpretation. Everything points to \u03b8 being \u03c0/2.\n\nJust to recap:\n\n1. Calculate r using r = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = 3.\n2. Since x is 0 and y is positive, the point is on the positive y-axis, which corresponds to \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\n\nTherefore, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polar coordinates are \\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the rectangular coordinates \\((0, 3)\\) to polar coordinates, we use the formulas for \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\).\n\n1. Calculate \\(r\\) using the formula \\(r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\\):\n   \\[\n   r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{0 + 9} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine \\(\\theta\\) using the fact that the point \\((0, 3)\\) lies on the positive y-axis.

Let me write down what I know.\n\nFirst, p is defined as the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/k\u00b2. I remember that this is a well-known series, called the Basel problem, and its sum is \u03c0\u00b2/6. But here, they just call it p, so I'll stick with that.\n\nSimilarly, q is the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/k\u00b3. I don't remember the exact value of this off the top of my head, but I know it's known as Ap\u00e9ry's constant and is approximately 1.2020569... but again, in this problem, it's just referred to as q.\n\nNow, the main task is to find a way to write the double sum S = sum_{j=1}^\u221e sum_{k=1}^\u221e 1/(j + k)^3 in terms of p and q. Hmm, okay.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can find a way to relate this double sum to the individual sums p and q. Since both p and q are sums involving 1/k\u00b2 and 1/k\u00b3, perhaps I can manipulate the double sum to express it in terms of these.\n\nFirst, let's write out the double sum explicitly:\n\nS = sum_{j=1}^\u221e sum_{k=1}^\u221e 1/(j + k)^3.\n\nThis is a double sum where both j and k start from 1 and go to infinity. So, for each j, we're summing over k from 1 to infinity of 1/(j + k)^3. Maybe I can switch the order of summation or find another way to express this.\n\nWait, let's make a substitution. Let me set n = j + k. Then, for each fixed n, j can range from 1 to n - 1, because k = n - j, which must be at least 1. So, k = n - j \u2265 1 implies j \u2264 n - 1. So, for each n \u2265 2, the term 1/n\u00b3 appears (n - 1) times, once for each j from 1 to n - 1.\n\nSo, S can be rewritten as sum_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3. Let me check that.\n\nYes, because for each n starting from 2, there are (n - 1) pairs (j, k) such that j + k = n, each contributing 1/n\u00b3. So, summing over n from 2 to infinity, each term is (n - 1)/n\u00b3.\n\nSo, S = sum_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3.\n\nNow, let's simplify this expression. Let's write (n - 1)/n\u00b3 as (n/n\u00b3 - 1/n\u00b3) = 1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, S = sum_{n=2}^\u221e (1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3) = sum_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2 - sum_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3.\n\nNow, let's relate this to p and q. We know that p = sum_{n=1}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2, so sum_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2 = p - 1. Similarly, q = sum_{n=1}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3, so sum_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3 = q - 1.\n\nTherefore, substituting back into S, we get:\n\nS = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q.\n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.\n\nStarting from S = sum_{j=1}^\u221e sum_{k=1}^\u221e 1/(j + k)^3.\n\nWe set n = j + k, so for each n, j can go from 1 to n - 1, and k = n - j. Therefore, for each n \u2265 2, the term 1/n\u00b3 is added (n - 1) times, so S becomes sum_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3.\n\nThen, (n - 1)/n\u00b3 = 1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3, so S = sum_{n=2}^\u221e (1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3) = sum_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2 - sum_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3.\n\nSince p = sum_{n=1}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2, then sum_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2 = p - 1.\n\nSimilarly, q = sum_{n=1}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3, so sum_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3 = q - 1.\n\nTherefore, S = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.\n\nSo, indeed, S = p - q.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because I started with a double sum and transformed it into a single sum, which seems right, but let me test with small values.\n\nLet me compute the double sum for j and k from 1 to 2 and see if it matches p - q.\n\nCompute S manually for j, k = 1,2:\n\nWhen j=1, k=1: 1/(1+1)^3 = 1/8\n\nj=1, k=2: 1/3\u00b3 = 1/27\n\nj=2, k=1: 1/3\u00b3 = 1/27\n\nj=2, k=2: 1/4\u00b3 = 1/64\n\nSo, total S (truncated) is 1/8 + 1/27 + 1/27 + 1/64.\n\nCompute this: 1/8 is 0.125, 1/27 \u2248 0.037037, so two of those \u2248 0.074074, and 1/64 \u2248 0.015625.\n\nAdding up: 0.125 + 0.074074 \u2248 0.199074 + 0.015625 \u2248 0.2147.\n\nNow, compute p - q, where p = \u03c0\u00b2/6 \u2248 1.6449, q \u2248 1.2020569.\n\nSo, p - q \u2248 1.6449 - 1.2020569 \u2248 0.4428.\n\nWait, but our manual computation for j, k=1,2 gave about 0.2147, which is less than 0.4428. So, is our conclusion that S = p - q correct?\n\nWait, maybe not. Because when we take j and k to infinity, the sum S is equal to p - q, but when we take only j, k up to 2, it's just a partial sum. So, the partial sum is 0.2147, but the total sum is 0.4428, which is more than twice as big. So, maybe that doesn't contradict.\n\nBut let me check another way. Let's compute S up to n=3.\n\nSo, for n=2: (n-1)/n\u00b3 = 1/8, which is 0.125\n\nn=3: 2/27 \u2248 0.074074\n\nn=4: 3/64 \u2248 0.046875\n\nn=5: 4/125 = 0.032\n\nn=6: 5/216 \u2248 0.023148\n\nn=7: 6/343 \u2248 0.01749\n\nn=8: 7/512 \u2248 0.01367\n\nAdding these up:\n\n0.125 + 0.074074 \u2248 0.199074\n\n+ 0.046875 \u2248 0.245949\n\n+ 0.032 \u2248 0.277949\n\n+ 0.023148 \u2248 0.301097\n\n+ 0.01749 \u2248 0.318587\n\n+ 0.01367 \u2248 0.332257\n\nSo, up to n=8, the partial sum is approximately 0.332257.\n\nNow, the total S is p - q \u2248 0.4428, so it's approaching that value as n increases. So, maybe the formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about another approach.\n\nPerhaps I can express the double sum as a convolution of two sequences. Since the terms involve j + k, it's similar to a convolution.\n\nWait, in general, the sum over j and k of a_j a_k is the square of the sum, but here it's 1/(j + k)^3, which is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can relate it to the Riemann zeta function.\n\nWait, the sum S can be written as sum_{j=1}^\u221e sum_{k=1}^\u221e 1/(j + k)^3.\n\nLet me consider changing variables: let m = j + k. Then, for each m, j can be from 1 to m - 1, as before.\n\nSo, S = sum_{m=2}^\u221e (m - 1)/m\u00b3, which is the same as before.\n\nSo, S = sum_{m=2}^\u221e (1/m\u00b2 - 1/m\u00b3) = sum_{m=2}^\u221e 1/m\u00b2 - sum_{m=2}^\u221e 1/m\u00b3 = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.\n\nTherefore, that seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me think about the original double sum. It's sum_{j=1}^\u221e sum_{k=1}^\u221e 1/(j + k)^3.\n\nIs there another way to express this? Maybe by integrating or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using generating functions.\n\nWait, let's consider that 1/(j + k)^3 is the same as the integral from 0 to 1 of x^{j + k - 1} ln(1/x) dx. Wait, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps recognizing that 1/(j + k)^3 can be expressed as an integral.\n\nWait, maybe integrating term by term. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, I know that 1/n^3 = \u222b_{0}^{1} x^{n - 1} dx / 2, but that doesn't seem directly helpful.\n\nWait, actually, 1/n^3 can be represented as \u222b_{0}^{1} \u222b_{0}^{1} (xy)^{n - 1} dx dy, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the integral representation of 1/n^3.\n\nWait, another idea: since 1/n^3 = \u222b_{0}^{1} x^{n - 1} (-ln x) dx, because \u222b_{0}^{1} x^{n - 1} dx = 1/n, and integrating against -ln x gives the extra factor.\n\nWait, yes, in general, \u222b_{0}^{1} x^{k} (-ln x) dx = 1/(k + 1)^2.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nLet me compute \u222b_{0}^{1} x^{k} (-ln x) dx.\n\nLet me set t = -ln x, so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt.\n\nWhen x=0, t=\u221e; x=1, t=0. So, the integral becomes \u222b_{\u221e}^{0} (e^{-t})^k t (-e^{-t} dt) = \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} e^{-(k + 1)t} t dt.\n\nWhich is \u222b_{0}^{\u221e} t e^{-(k + 1)t} dt = 1/(k + 1)^2.\n\nYes, correct. So, \u222b_{0}^{1} x^{k} (-ln x) dx = 1/(k + 1)^2.\n\nSo, that means 1/(k + 1)^3 = \u222b_{0}^{1} x^{k} (-ln x) / (k + 1) dx.\n\nWait, maybe not directly.\n\nWait, but if I have 1/(j + k)^3, perhaps I can write that as \u222b_{0}^{1} x^{j + k - 1} (-ln x) dx / (j + k). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another integral representation.\n\nWait, perhaps using the fact that 1/n^3 = \u222b_{0}^{1} \u222b_{0}^{1} (xy)^{n - 1} dx dy, but I don't think that's correct.\n\nWait, let's see: \u222b_{0}^{1} x^{n - 1} dx = 1/n, so \u222b_{0}^{1} \u222b_{0}^{1} (xy)^{n - 1} dx dy = (1/n)^2 = 1/n\u00b2. So, that gives 1/n\u00b2, not 1/n\u00b3.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a double integral:\n\nWe know that 1/n\u00b3 = \u222b_{0}^{1} \u222b_{0}^{1} x^{n - 1} y^{n - 1} dx dy. Wait, no, that would be (1/n)^2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using a triple integral? Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using generating functions.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial approach.\n\nSo, S = sum_{j=1}^\\infty sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(j + k)^3.\n\nWe transformed variables to m = j + k, and found that S = sum_{m=2}^\\infty (m - 1)/m\u00b3.\n\nThen, we split that into sum_{m=2}^\\infty 1/m\u00b2 - sum_{m=2}^\\infty 1/m\u00b3 = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.\n\nSo, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me check for another small case.\n\nSuppose j and k go from 1 to 3.\n\nCompute S manually:\n\nFor j=1, k=1: 1/8\n\nj=1, k=2: 1/27\n\nj=1, k=3: 1/64\n\nj=2, k=1: 1/27\n\nj=2, k=2: 1/64\n\nj=2, k=3: 1/125\n\nj=3, k=1: 1/64\n\nj=3, k=2: 1/125\n\nj=3, k=3: 1/216\n\nSo, adding all these up:\n\n1/8 \u2248 0.125\n\n+ 1/27 \u2248 0.037037 (total \u2248 0.162037)\n\n+ 1/64 \u2248 0.015625 (\u2248 0.177662)\n\n+ 1/27 \u2248 0.037037 (\u2248 0.214699)\n\n+ 1/64 \u2248 0.015625 (\u2248 0.230324)\n\n+ 1/125 \u2248 0.008 (\u2248 0.238324)\n\n+ 1/64 \u2248 0.015625 (\u2248 0.253949)\n\n+ 1/125 \u2248 0.008 (\u2248 0.261949)\n\n+ 1/216 \u2248 0.00463 (\u2248 0.266579)\n\nSo, total \u2248 0.266579.\n\nNow, compute p - q: p \u2248 1.6449, q \u2248 1.2020569, so p - q \u2248 0.4428.\n\nSo, with j, k up to 3, we have S \u2248 0.266579, which is about 60% of p - q. So, that seems reasonable, as the sum converges to p - q.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: perhaps using generating functions or known identities.\n\nWait, let me recall that the sum over j and k of 1/(j + k)^n can sometimes be expressed in terms of zeta functions.\n\nIn this case, n=3, so maybe we can use some convolution.\n\nWait, in general, sum_{j=1}^\\infty sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(j + k)^n = sum_{m=2}^\\infty (m - 1)/m^n.\n\nWhich is similar to what we did before.\n\nSo, for n=3, it's sum_{m=2}^\\infty (m - 1)/m\u00b3 = sum_{m=2}^\\infty 1/m\u00b2 - 1/m\u00b3.\n\nWhich is p - 1 - (q - 1) = p - q.\n\nTherefore, this seems to hold.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let me see if I can find a reference or another way to compute this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the double sum as the convolution of two sequences.\n\nWait, but I think the substitution method is solid here.\n\nSo, to recap:\n\nS = sum_{j=1}^\\infty sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(j + k)^3.\n\nLet m = j + k, so for each m, j can be 1 to m - 1, so k = m - j.\n\nTherefore, S = sum_{m=2}^\\infty sum_{j=1}^{m - 1} 1/m\u00b3 = sum_{m=2}^\\infty (m - 1)/m\u00b3.\n\nThen, (m - 1)/m\u00b3 = m/m\u00b3 - 1/m\u00b3 = 1/m\u00b2 - 1/m\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, S = sum_{m=2}^\\infty (1/m\u00b2 - 1/m\u00b3) = sum_{m=2}^\\infty 1/m\u00b2 - sum_{m=2}^\\infty 1/m\u00b3.\n\nBut sum_{m=2}^\\infty 1/m\u00b2 = p - 1, since p = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/m\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, sum_{m=2}^\\infty 1/m\u00b3 = q - 1, since q = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/m\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, S = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nI don't see any flaws in this reasoning. The substitution makes sense, and breaking down the fraction into 1/m\u00b2 - 1/m\u00b3 is valid.

Express your answer as a common fraction.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to find the value of f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) where the function f(x) is given as (3x - 2)/(x - 2). Hmm, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that to find f(-2), f(-1), and f(0), I just need to substitute each of these x-values into the function and calculate the result. Then, I'll add all those results together. That makes sense. So, I should handle each term one by one.\n\nStarting with f(-2). Let me plug in x = -2 into the function. So, the numerator becomes 3*(-2) - 2. Let me compute that: 3 times -2 is -6, and then subtracting 2 gives me -6 - 2, which is -8. \n\nNow, the denominator is x - 2, so substituting x = -2, it becomes -2 - 2. That's -4. So, f(-2) is (-8)/(-4). Dividing two negatives gives a positive, so that's 8/4, which simplifies to 2. Okay, so f(-2) is 2. That was straightforward.\n\nNext up is f(-1). Again, substituting x = -1 into the function. Numerator: 3*(-1) - 2. Let's compute that. 3*(-1) is -3, minus 2 is -5. \n\nDenominator: x - 2, so substituting x = -1 gives -1 - 2, which is -3. So, f(-1) is (-5)/(-3). Dividing two negatives gives positive, so that's 5/3. Hmm, that's a fraction, so I'll keep that as it is for now. So, f(-1) is 5/3.\n\nMoving on to f(0). Substituting x = 0 into the function. Numerator: 3*0 - 2. That's 0 - 2, which is -2. \n\nDenominator: x - 2, so substituting x = 0 gives 0 - 2, which is -2. So, f(0) is (-2)/(-2). Dividing two negatives gives positive 1. So, f(0) is 1. That was simple enough.\n\nNow, I need to add these three results together: f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) which is 2 + 5/3 + 1. Let me write that out: 2 + 1 is 3, and then 3 + 5/3. \n\nWait, let me make sure. Actually, 2 + 1 is 3, and then adding 5/3. Hmm, 3 is the same as 9/3, so 9/3 + 5/3 is 14/3. Alternatively, I could have added all together: 2 + 5/3 + 1. \n\nAlternatively, adding 2 and 1 first gives 3, and then adding 5/3. Since 3 is 3/1, to add 3/1 and 5/3, I need a common denominator. The least common denominator is 3. So, 3/1 is 9/3, and 5/3 is already over 3. So, 9/3 + 5/3 is indeed 14/3. \n\nSo, the total sum is 14/3. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nFirst, f(-2): numerator 3*(-2) - 2 is -6 - 2 = -8. Denominator is -2 - 2 = -4. So, -8/-4 is 2. Correct.\n\nNext, f(-1): numerator 3*(-1) - 2 is -3 - 2 = -5. Denominator is -1 - 2 = -3. So, -5/-3 is 5/3. Correct.\n\nThen, f(0): numerator 3*0 - 2 is 0 - 2 = -2. Denominator is 0 - 2 = -2. So, -2/-2 is 1. Correct.\n\nAdding them: 2 + 5/3 + 1. Converting all to thirds: 2 is 6/3, 5/3 is 5/3, 1 is 3/3. So, 6/3 + 5/3 + 3/3 = (6 + 5 + 3)/3 = 14/3. Yep, that's correct.\n\nWait, hold on, when I converted 2 to thirds, I thought 2 is 6/3, but then I added 5/3 and 3/3. Let me check that again. 2 is 6/3, 1 is 3/3. So, 6/3 + 5/3 + 3/3 is 14/3. Yes, that's right.\n\nAlternatively, adding 2 + 1 gives 3, which is 9/3, plus 5/3 is 14/3. Either way, same result. So, confident that the sum is 14/3.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Each substitution was done correctly, and the arithmetic seems right. So, I think the answer is 14/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) where the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{3x - 2}{x - 2} \\), we substitute each value into the function and then sum the results.\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( f(-2) \\):\n\\[\nf(-2) = \\frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \\frac{-6 - 2}{-4} = \\frac{-8}{-4} = 2\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( f(-1) \\):\n\\[\nf(-1) = \\frac{3(-1) - 2}{-1 - 2} = \\frac{-3 - 2}{-3} = \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3}\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate \\( f(0) \\):\n\\[\nf(0) = \\frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} = \\frac{0 - 2}{-2} = \\frac{-2}{-2} = 1\n\\]\n\nAdding these results together:\n\\[\nf(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + \\frac{5}{3} + 1\n\\]\n\nConverting all terms to a common denominator (3):\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{6}{3}, \\quad 1 = \\frac{3}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n2 + \\frac{5}{3} + 1 = \\frac{6}{3} + \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{6 + 5 + 3}{3} = \\frac{14}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}.", "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has. Hmm, divisors are numbers that divide 196 without leaving any remainder. Alright, so I guess I should start by understanding what exactly a divisor is. A divisor of a number is another number that can divide into it evenly, right? So for example, 1 is a divisor of every number, and the number itself is also a divisor. So 1 and 196 are definitely divisors.\n\nBut there are more divisors in between. I remember that to find all the divisors, it's helpful to first find the prime factorization of the number. Prime factorization breaks down a number into the product of its prime numbers. So I need to factor 196 into primes. Let me try that.\n\n196 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. 196 divided by 2 is 98. Okay, so 2 is a prime factor. Now, 98 is also even, so I can divide that by 2 again. 98 divided by 2 is 49. So now I have 2 times 2 times 49. 49 is a number I recognize as 7 squared, right? So 49 is 7 times 7. So putting it all together, the prime factors of 196 are 2 squared times 7 squared, which is written as \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\).\n\nAlright, so now that I have the prime factorization, I remember there's a formula to find the number of divisors. I think it's something like taking the exponents of the prime factors, adding one to each, and then multiplying those together. Let me see if I can recall that correctly.\n\nSo, for each prime factor, you take its exponent, add 1 to it, and then multiply all those together. So in this case, the exponents are 2 for 2 and 2 for 7. So for 2, it's 2 plus 1, which is 3, and for 7, it's also 2 plus 1, which is 3. Then multiply those together: 3 times 3 is 9. So does that mean 196 has 9 positive divisors? Hmm, that seems right.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should list them out and count. Let me try that. Starting from 1, which is a divisor of every number. Then, 2, because 196 is even. 4, since 196 divided by 4 is 49. 7, because 7 times 28 is 196. 14, since 14 times 14 is 196. Wait, no, 14 times 14 is actually 196? Let me check: 14 times 14 is 196. Yes, that's correct. So 14 is a divisor.\n\nContinuing on, 28, because 28 times 7 is 196. Then 49, since 49 times 4 is 196. Then 98, because 98 times 2 is 196. And finally, 196 itself. Let me list them: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. That's nine numbers. So that matches the calculation I did earlier. So 196 has 9 positive divisors.\n\nWait, hold on, is 14 times 14 equal to 196? Let me calculate that. 14 times 10 is 140, 14 times 4 is 56, so 140 plus 56 is 196. Yes, that's correct. So 14 is a square root of 196, which makes sense because 14 squared is 196. So that's why 14 is a divisor.\n\nBut let me just think again about the formula. If a number N can be expressed as \\(p^a \\times q^b\\), where p and q are prime numbers, then the number of divisors is (a+1)(b+1). So in this case, 196 is \\(2^2 \\times 7^2\\), so exponents are 2 and 2. Therefore, number of divisors is (2+1)(2+1) = 3*3=9. That seems consistent.\n\nI was a bit confused earlier when I thought 14 times 14 is 196, but I verified that, so that's correct. So, each of these divisors can be paired with another to multiply to 196. For example, 1 pairs with 196, 2 pairs with 98, 4 pairs with 49, 7 pairs with 28, and 14 pairs with 14. So, that's 5 pairs, but since 14 is the square root, it's paired with itself, so it counts only once. So in total, that's 9 divisors.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the exponents, for each prime factor, the exponent can range from 0 up to its maximum in the prime factorization. So for 2, the exponent can be 0, 1, or 2. Similarly, for 7, the exponent can be 0, 1, or 2. So, the number of combinations is 3 (for 2) multiplied by 3 (for 7), which is 9. Each combination gives a unique divisor.\n\nLet me test that with an example. If I take 2^0 * 7^0, that's 1. 2^0 * 7^1 is 7. 2^0 * 7^2 is 49. Then, 2^1 * 7^0 is 2. 2^1 * 7^1 is 14. 2^1 * 7^2 is 98. Then, 2^2 * 7^0 is 4. 2^2 * 7^1 is 28. 2^2 * 7^2 is 196. So, that gives all the divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Yep, that's nine divisors. So that method works.\n\nI think I'm confident now that 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors. I went through different methods: listing them out, using the prime factorization formula, and verifying with the pairing method. All of them led me to the same answer, so I think it's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, we start by finding its prime factorization. \n\n196 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:\n\\[ 196 \\div 2 = 98 \\]\n98 is also even, so we divide by 2 again:\n\\[ 98 \\div 2 = 49 \\]\n49 is a prime number squared:\n\\[ 49 = 7^2 \\]\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n\\[ 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\]\n\nUsing the formula for the number of divisors, we take the exponents of the prime factors, add 1 to each, and multiply the results:\n\\[ (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\nTo verify, we list the divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. Counting these, we find there are 9 divisors.\n\nThus, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."]
