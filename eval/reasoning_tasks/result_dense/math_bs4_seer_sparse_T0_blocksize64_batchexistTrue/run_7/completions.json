Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinates (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, \u03b8), where r is the distance from the origin and \u03b8 is the angle made with the positive x-axis. Let me think about how to calculate r and \u03b8 from the given rectangular coordinates.\n\nFirst, the rectangular coordinates are (x, y) = (0, 3). I think the formula for r is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, right? So, r should be the square root of (x squared plus y squared). Let me write that down:\n\nr = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nr = \u221a(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = \u221a(0 + 9) = \u221a9 = 3\n\nOkay, so r is 3. That makes sense because the point is on the y-axis, 3 units away from the origin, so the distance should be 3.\n\nNow, onto finding \u03b8. I recall that \u03b8 is calculated using the arctangent function, specifically \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But wait, in this case, x is 0, so I need to be careful because dividing by zero isn't allowed. Hmm, what happens when x is zero?\n\nI think when x is 0, the point lies on the y-axis. Since the y-coordinate is positive (3), the point is on the positive y-axis. In polar coordinates, the positive y-axis corresponds to an angle of \u03c0/2 radians or 90 degrees. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, the angle \u03b8 is measured from the positive x-axis, and going counterclockwise, 0 radians is along the positive x-axis. So, moving up along the positive y-axis would be 90 degrees, which is \u03c0/2 in radians. So, \u03b8 should be \u03c0/2.\n\nLet me just make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Sometimes, when dealing with arctangent, you have to consider the quadrant in which the point lies to get the correct angle. But in this case, since the point is on the positive y-axis, it's straightforward. There's no ambiguity because the point isn't in a quadrant where x and y are both non-zero.\n\nSo, putting it all together, r is 3 and \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. Therefore, the polar coordinates should be (3, \u03c0/2).\n\nWait a second, let me double-check my calculations. If I convert (3, \u03c0/2) back to rectangular coordinates, I should get (0, 3). The conversion formulas are:\n\nx = r * cos(\u03b8)\ny = r * sin(\u03b8)\n\nSo, plugging in:\n\nx = 3 * cos(\u03c0/2) = 3 * 0 = 0\ny = 3 * sin(\u03c0/2) = 3 * 1 = 3\n\nYes, that gives us (0, 3), which is the original point. So, my calculations seem correct.\n\nI think I got it. So, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polar coordinates are \\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the rectangular coordinates \\((0, 3)\\) to polar coordinates, we need to find \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\).\n\nFirst, we calculate \\(r\\) using the formula:\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\]\nSubstituting \\(x = 0\\) and \\(y = 3\\):\n\\[ r = \\sqrt{0^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{9} = 3 \\]\n\nNext, we determine \\(\\theta\\). Since the point \\((0, 3)\\) lies on the positive y-axis, the angle \\(\\theta\\) is:\n\\[ \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\]\n\nThus, the polar coordinates are:\n\\[ (r, \\theta) = \\left(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}\n\\]", "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>Define\n\\[p = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad q = \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}.\\]Find a way to write\n\\[\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\]in terms of $p$ and $q.$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I have this problem where I need to express a double sum in terms of two known sums, p and q. Let me write down what I know:\n\nFirst, p is defined as the sum from k = 1 to infinity of 1/k\u00b2. I remember that this is a well-known series called the Basel problem, and its value is \u03c0\u00b2/6. But since the problem wants me to express things in terms of p and q, I'll just stick with p for now.\n\nSimilarly, q is the sum from k = 1 to infinity of 1/k\u00b3. I don't recall an exact value for this, but it's known as Ap\u00e9ry's constant, and it's approximately 1.202... Anyway, again, I'll just use q as defined.\n\nNow, the main task is to find a way to write the double sum S = sum_{j=1}^\u221e sum_{k=1}^\u221e 1/(j + k)^3 in terms of p and q. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nDouble sums can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can find a clever way to relate this to the single sums p and q. I remember that sometimes, when dealing with double sums, changing the variables or finding a way to express them as products of single sums can be helpful. But in this case, since the denominator is (j + k)^3, it's a bit more complicated than just the product of j and k.\n\nLet me try to visualize the terms. For each j and k, we have 1/(j + k)^3. So, for each fixed j, as k increases, the term 1/(j + k)^3 decreases. Similarly, for each fixed k, as j increases, the term decreases. Maybe I can fix one variable and sum over the other, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can change variables. Let me set n = j + k. Then, for each n, the number of pairs (j, k) such that j + k = n is equal to n - 1, because j can range from 1 to n - 1, and k is then determined as n - j. So, perhaps I can rewrite the double sum as a single sum over n, multiplied by the number of terms for each n.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nS = sum_{j=1}^\u221e sum_{k=1}^\u221e 1/(j + k)^3\n= sum_{n=2}^\u221e (sum_{j=1}^{n-1} 1/n^3)\n= sum_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n^3\n\nWait, that seems promising. So, each n starts from 2 because the smallest j and k are 1, so j + k is 2. Then, for each n, we have (n - 1) terms each equal to 1/n\u00b3, so the inner sum is (n - 1)/n\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, S = sum_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3.\n\nNow, let me see if I can express this sum in terms of p and q. Let me write out the first few terms to see if I can recognize a pattern or relate it to known sums.\n\nFor n = 2: (2 - 1)/2\u00b3 = 1/8\nFor n = 3: (3 - 1)/3\u00b3 = 2/27\nFor n = 4: (4 - 1)/4\u00b3 = 3/64\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, the general term is (n - 1)/n\u00b3 = (n/n\u00b3) - (1/n\u00b3) = 1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, S = sum_{n=2}^\u221e (1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3) = sum_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2 - sum_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3.\n\nNow, I can relate these sums to p and q. Since p = sum_{k=1}^\u221e 1/k\u00b2, then sum_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2 is just p - 1 (because we subtract the first term when k=1). Similarly, sum_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3 is q - 1 (subtracting the first term when k=1).\n\nSo, substituting back:\n\nS = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q.\n\nWait, that's nice! The constants cancel out, so S = p - q.\n\nBut let me double-check that reasoning. So, I converted the double sum into a single sum over n starting from 2, each term being (n - 1)/n\u00b3, which I split into 1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3. Then, summing from n=2 to infinity, those sums become p - 1 and q - 1, respectively. Subtracting those gives p - q.\n\nLet me verify with a small example. Suppose I take finite sums to test this. Let\u2019s say we take j and k from 1 to 2.\n\nThen, the double sum S would be:\n\nFor j=1, k=1: 1/(1+1)^3 = 1/8\nFor j=1, k=2: 1/(1+2)^3 = 1/27\nFor j=2, k=1: 1/(2+1)^3 = 1/27\nFor j=2, k=2: 1/(2+2)^3 = 1/64\n\nSo, total S = 1/8 + 1/27 + 1/27 + 1/64 \u2248 0.125 + 0.037 + 0.037 + 0.0156 \u2248 0.2146.\n\nNow, let's compute p and q up to k=2:\n\np = 1 + 1/4 = 1.25\nq = 1 + 1/8 = 1.125\nSo, p - q = 1.25 - 1.125 = 0.125.\n\nBut wait, the actual finite sum S is approximately 0.2146, which is larger than p - q. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps my substitution is missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWhen I set n = j + k, for finite j and k up to N, the number of terms for each n is (n - 1), but when j and k go to infinity, n goes to infinity as well. However, in the finite case, n goes up to 2N.\n\nBut when I expressed S as sum_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3, that's for j and k going to infinity. But when I tested it with finite sums, it didn't match. So, perhaps my initial step was correct, but the finite case isn't a good approximation because it's only a small part of the infinite sum.\n\nWait, let me compute S using the formula p - q and see if it matches the partial sums.\n\nGiven that p = \u03c0\u00b2/6 \u2248 1.6449 and q \u2248 1.2020569. So, p - q \u2248 0.4428.\n\nBut when I calculated the finite sum up to j=2, k=2, I got approximately 0.2146, which is less than 0.4428. So, the infinite sum should be larger. Let me compute more terms.\n\nCompute S up to j=3, k=3:\n\nj=1: k=1: 1/8; k=2:1/27; k=3:1/64\nj=2: k=1:1/27; k=2:1/64; k=3:1/125\nj=3: k=1:1/64; k=2:1/125; k=3:1/216\n\nCalculating each term:\n\n1/8 = 0.125\n1/27 \u2248 0.037037\n1/64 \u2248 0.015625\n1/125 = 0.008\n1/216 \u2248 0.00463\n\nAdding up:\n\nj=1: 0.125 + 0.037037 + 0.015625 \u2248 0.177662\nj=2: 0.037037 + 0.015625 + 0.008 \u2248 0.060662\nj=3: 0.015625 + 0.008 + 0.00463 \u2248 0.028255\n\nTotal S \u2248 0.177662 + 0.060662 + 0.028255 \u2248 0.266579\n\nStill, this is less than p - q \u2248 0.4428. So, it seems that as we add more terms, S approaches p - q. So, maybe the formula is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the transformation.\n\nLet me go back:\n\nOriginal double sum S = sum_{j=1}^\u221e sum_{k=1}^\u221e 1/(j + k)^3.\n\nChange variable to n = j + k, then for each n \u2265 2, the number of pairs (j, k) such that j + k = n is (n - 1). So, S = sum_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3.\n\nThen, S = sum_{n=2}^\u221e (n/n\u00b3 - 1/n\u00b3) = sum_{n=2}^\u221e (1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3).\n\nWhich is equal to sum_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2 - sum_{n=2}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3.\n\nWhich is (sum_{n=1}^\u221e 1/n\u00b2 - 1) - (sum_{n=1}^\u221e 1/n\u00b3 - 1) = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.\n\nYes, so that seems correct.\n\nTherefore, despite the finite sums giving a smaller value, the infinite sum does indeed equal p - q.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me compute S numerically using another approach.\n\nCompute S = sum_{j=1}^\u221e sum_{k=1}^\u221e 1/(j + k)^3.\n\nAlternatively, note that this is equivalent to sum_{m=2}^\u221e (m - 1)/m\u00b3, as we had before.\n\nCompute this sum numerically:\n\nsum_{m=2}^\u221e (m - 1)/m\u00b3 = sum_{m=2}^\u221e (1/m\u00b2 - 1/m\u00b3).\n\nWe can compute this as (sum_{m=2}^\u221e 1/m\u00b2) - (sum_{m=2}^\u221e 1/m\u00b3) = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.\n\nTherefore, it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, I can think about generating functions or integral representations, but since we've already transformed it into a single sum which can be expressed in terms of p and q, perhaps that's sufficient.\n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way to approach this, just to verify.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe express 1/(j + k)^3 as an integral.\n\nI know that 1/n\u00b3 can be expressed as an integral, perhaps. For example, 1/n\u00b3 = \u222b_0^1 x^{n - 1} dx \u222b_0^1 y^{n - 1} dy, but I'm not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, I remember that 1/n = \u222b_0^1 x^{n - 1} dx, so perhaps higher powers can be expressed as multiple integrals.\n\nBut maybe that complicates things. Alternatively, I know that 1/n\u00b3 is related to the Riemann zeta function, which is what q is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can relate the double sum to the convolution of two sequences.\n\nWait, the double sum sum_{j=1}^\u221e sum_{k=1}^\u221e f(j + k) can sometimes be expressed as the convolution of f with itself, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the integral representation:\n\n1/(j + k)^3 = \u222b_0^1 x^{j + k - 1} dx * something.\n\nWait, 1/(j + k)^3 = \u222b_0^1 x^{j + k - 1} ( -ln x )^2 / 2 dx, because integrating x^{n} gives 1/(n + 1), but higher powers of logarithms can give higher negative powers.\n\nWait, let me recall that:\n\n\u222b_0^1 x^{n} dx = 1/(n + 1)\n\n\u222b_0^1 x^{n} (-ln x) dx = 1/(n + 1)^2\n\nSimilarly, \u222b_0^1 x^{n} (-ln x)^2 dx = 2/(n + 1)^3\n\nYes, that's right. So, 1/(n + 1)^3 = (1/2) \u222b_0^1 x^{n} (-ln x)^2 dx.\n\nTherefore, 1/(j + k)^3 = (1/2) \u222b_0^1 x^{j + k - 1} (-ln x)^2 dx.\n\nSo, substituting this into S:\n\nS = sum_{j=1}^\u221e sum_{k=1}^\u221e [ (1/2) \u222b_0^1 x^{j + k - 1} (-ln x)^2 dx ]\n\n= (1/2) \u222b_0^1 (-ln x)^2 sum_{j=1}^\u221e x^{j} sum_{k=1}^\u221e x^{k} dx\n\nBecause sum_{j=1}^\u221e x^{j} is a geometric series: sum_{j=1}^\u221e x^{j} = x / (1 - x) for |x| < 1.\n\nSimilarly for sum_{k=1}^\u221e x^{k} = x / (1 - x).\n\nTherefore, S = (1/2) \u222b_0^1 (-ln x)^2 [x / (1 - x)]^2 dx.\n\nHmm, that's an integral representation of S. Maybe I can evaluate this integral in terms of p and q.\n\nLet me write that:\n\nS = (1/2) \u222b_0^1 [ (-ln x)^2 * (x^2) / (1 - x)^2 ] dx.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps directly, but perhaps I can make a substitution.\n\nLet me set t = -ln x, so when x = 0, t = \u221e, and when x = 1, t = 0. Then, dx = -e^{-t} dt.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nx = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt\n\nSo, x^2 = e^{-2t}, and (1 - x)^2 = (1 - e^{-t})^2.\n\nTherefore, S becomes:\n\nS = (1/2) \u222b_{t=\u221e}^0 [ t^2 * e^{-2t} / (1 - e^{-t})^2 ] (-e^{-t}) dt\n\nThe negative sign flips the limits:\n\n= (1/2) \u222b_{0}^\u221e [ t^2 * e^{-2t} / (1 - e^{-t})^2 ] e^{-t} dt\n\n= (1/2) \u222b_{0}^\u221e [ t^2 * e^{-3t} / (1 - e^{-t})^2 ] dt\n\nHmm, okay. Let me simplify (1 - e^{-t})^{-2}:\n\nNote that 1/(1 - e^{-t})^2 = sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1) e^{-nt}, which is the generating function for (n + 1).\n\nTherefore, 1/(1 - e^{-t})^2 = sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1) e^{-nt}\n\nTherefore, S can be written as:\n\nS = (1/2) \u222b_{0}^\u221e t^2 e^{-3t} sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1) e^{-nt} dt\n\n= (1/2) sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1) \u222b_{0}^\u221e t^2 e^{-(3 + n)t} dt\n\nNow, the integral \u222b_{0}^\u221e t^2 e^{-at} dt is equal to 2!/a\u00b3 = 2/a\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, substituting back:\n\nS = (1/2) sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1) * (2)/(3 + n)^3\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/2) * 2 * sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1)/(n + 3)^3\n\n= sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1)/(n + 3)^3\n\nLet me change the index to m = n + 3, so when n = 0, m = 3, and n = m - 3.\n\nWait, but n starts at 0, so m starts at 3.\n\nWait, let me write it as:\n\nsum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1)/(n + 3)^3 = sum_{m=3}^\u221e (m - 2)/m\u00b3\n\n= sum_{m=3}^\u221e (m/m\u00b3 - 2/m\u00b3) = sum_{m=3}^\u221e (1/m\u00b2 - 2/m\u00b3)\n\nSo, S = sum_{m=3}^\u221e 1/m\u00b2 - 2 sum_{m=3}^\u221e 1/m\u00b3\n\nWhich is equal to (sum_{m=1}^\u221e 1/m\u00b2 - 1 - 1/4) - 2*(sum_{m=1}^\u221e 1/m\u00b3 - 1 - 1/8)\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (p - 1 - 1/4) - 2*(q - 1 - 1/8)\n= p - 5/4 - 2q + 2 + 1/4\n= p - 2q + ( -5/4 + 2 + 1/4 )\n= p - 2q + ( (-5/4 + 1/4) + 2 )\n= p - 2q + ( -1 + 2 )\n= p - 2q + 1\n\nWait, that's different from what I had earlier. But earlier, I found S = p - q.\n\nHmm, so which one is correct? There must be a mistake in this approach.\n\nWait, let me check the integral representation.\n\nI had:\n\nS = (1/2) \u222b_0^1 [ (-ln x)^2 * x^2 / (1 - x)^2 ] dx\n\nThen, substitution t = -ln x, so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt.\n\nThus, x^2 = e^{-2t}, (1 - x)^2 = (1 - e^{-t})^2.\n\nSo, S becomes:\n\n(1/2) \u222b_{0}^\u221e [ t^2 * e^{-2t} / (1 - e^{-t})^2 ] e^{-t} dt\n\n= (1/2) \u222b_{0}^\u221e t^2 e^{-3t} / (1 - e^{-t})^2 dt\n\nThen, expanding 1/(1 - e^{-t})^2 as sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1)e^{-nt}\n\nSo, S = (1/2) \u222b_{0}^\u221e t^2 e^{-3t} sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1)e^{-nt} dt\n\n= (1/2) sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1) \u222b_{0}^\u221e t^2 e^{-(3 + n)t} dt\n\nWhich is correct, as the integral is 2/(3 + n)^3.\n\nThus, S = sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1)/(3 + n)^3\n\nWait, that's correct, because 2/(3 + n)^3 multiplied by 1/2 gives 1/(3 + n)^3, and multiplied by (n + 1).\n\nSo, S = sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1)/(n + 3)^3\n\nWhich is equal to sum_{m=3}^\u221e (m - 2)/m\u00b3, by substituting m = n + 3.\n\nSo, S = sum_{m=3}^\u221e (m - 2)/m\u00b3 = sum_{m=3}^\u221e (1/m\u00b2 - 2/m\u00b3)\n\nWhich is equal to [sum_{m=3}^\u221e 1/m\u00b2] - 2[sum_{m=3}^\u221e 1/m\u00b3]\n\nBut sum_{m=3}^\u221e 1/m\u00b2 = p - 1 - 1/4\n\nSimilarly, sum_{m=3}^\u221e 1/m\u00b3 = q - 1 - 1/8\n\nTherefore, S = (p - 5/4) - 2(q - 9/8)\n\nWait, hold on:\n\nWait, sum_{m=3}^\u221e 1/m\u00b2 = p - 1 - 1/4 = p - 5/4\n\nSimilarly, sum_{m=3}^\u221e 1/m\u00b3 = q - 1 - 1/8 = q - 9/8\n\nTherefore, S = (p - 5/4) - 2*(q - 9/8)\n\nSimplify:\n\n= p - 5/4 - 2q + 9/4\n\n= p - 2q + ( -5/4 + 9/4 )\n\n= p - 2q + 4/4\n\n= p - 2q + 1\n\nWait, so S = p - 2q + 1\n\nBut earlier, I had S = p - q.\n\nSo, which one is correct?\n\nThis is a contradiction. I must have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let's compute both expressions numerically.\n\nCompute p = sum_{k=1}^\u221e 1/k\u00b2 \u2248 1.6449\n\nCompute q = sum_{k=1}^\u221e 1/k\u00b3 \u2248 1.2020569\n\nSo, p - q \u2248 0.4428\n\np - 2q + 1 \u2248 1.6449 - 2*1.2020569 + 1 \u2248 1.6449 - 2.4041138 + 1 \u2248 0.240786\n\nWait, but from the finite sums earlier, S was around 0.2665 with j,k up to 3, which is less than both 0.4428 and 0.240786. So, perhaps neither is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral approach. Alternatively, maybe the first approach was correct.\n\nWait, let's see: The initial substitution gave S = p - q \u2248 0.4428, but the integral approach gave S = p - 2q + 1 \u2248 0.240786.\n\nBut when I computed the finite sum up to j=3, k=3, I got approximately 0.2665, which is closer to 0.240786 than to 0.4428.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the integral approach might be correct, but I'm confused why the two methods give different results.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial substitution.\n\nWait, going back:\n\nOriginal double sum: S = sum_{j=1}^\u221e sum_{k=1}^\u221e 1/(j + k)^3\n\nThen, set n = j + k, so for each n \u2265 2, the number of pairs (j, k) is (n - 1). Therefore, S = sum_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3.\n\nWhich is equal to sum_{n=2}^\u221e (1/n\u00b2 - 1/n\u00b3) = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q.\n\nBut according to the integral approach, S = p - 2q + 1.\n\nThis is a problem because they should agree.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral representation.\n\nWait, let me check the integral representation again.\n\n1/(j + k)^3 = (1/2) \u222b_0^1 x^{j + k - 1} (-ln x)^2 dx\n\nTherefore, S = sum_{j,k} 1/(j + k)^3 = (1/2) \u222b_0^1 (-ln x)^2 sum_{j,k} x^{j + k - 1} dx\n\nBut sum_{j,k} x^{j + k - 1} = x^{-1} sum_{j} x^{j} sum_{k} x^{k} = x^{-1} (x / (1 - x))^2 = x / (1 - x)^2\n\nTherefore, S = (1/2) \u222b_0^1 (-ln x)^2 * x / (1 - x)^2 dx\n\nWait, previously I thought it was x^{j + k - 1} but actually, x^{j + k - 1} is x^{(j + k) - 1}, which is x^{-1} * x^{j + k}. So, sum_{j,k} x^{j + k - 1} = x^{-1} sum_{j,k} x^{j + k} = x^{-1} (sum_j x^j)(sum_k x^k) = x^{-1} (x/(1 - x))^2 = x/(1 - x)^2.\n\nTherefore, S = (1/2) \u222b_0^1 (-ln x)^2 * x / (1 - x)^2 dx.\n\nAh, I see. Earlier, I incorrectly substituted x^{j + k - 1} as e^{-2t} / (1 - e^{-t})^2, but actually, x^{j + k - 1} = x^{-1} x^{j + k}, so sum_{j,k} x^{j + k - 1} = x^{-1} (sum x^j)(sum x^k) = x^{-1} (x/(1 - x))^2 = x/(1 - x)^2.\n\nSo, that changes things.\n\nTherefore, S = (1/2) \u222b_0^1 (-ln x)^2 * x / (1 - x)^2 dx.\n\nNow, let me perform substitution t = -ln x, so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt.\n\nSo, x = e^{-t}, 1 - x = 1 - e^{-t}, and (-ln x)^2 = t\u00b2.\n\nThus, S becomes:\n\nS = (1/2) \u222b_{\u221e}^0 t\u00b2 * e^{-t} / (1 - e^{-t})^2 * (-e^{-t}) dt\n\n= (1/2) \u222b_{0}^\u221e t\u00b2 e^{-2t} / (1 - e^{-t})^2 dt\n\nNow, expand 1/(1 - e^{-t})^2 as sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1) e^{-nt}.\n\nTherefore, S = (1/2) \u222b_{0}^\u221e t\u00b2 e^{-2t} sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1) e^{-nt} dt\n\n= (1/2) sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1) \u222b_{0}^\u221e t\u00b2 e^{-(2 + n)t} dt\n\nThe integral \u222b_{0}^\u221e t\u00b2 e^{-at} dt = 2!/a\u00b3 = 2/a\u00b3.\n\nTherefore, S = (1/2) sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1) * 2/(2 + n)^3\n\nSimplify:\n\n= sum_{n=0}^\u221e (n + 1)/(n + 2)^3\n\nLet me change variables: Let m = n + 2, so when n = 0, m = 2, and n = m - 2.\n\nThus, S = sum_{m=2}^\u221e (m - 1)/m\u00b3\n\nWhich is exactly the same as the initial expression I had for S:\n\nS = sum_{n=2}^\u221e (n - 1)/n\u00b3 = sum_{m=2}^\u221e (m - 1)/m\u00b3.\n\nWhich we already showed is equal to p - q.\n\nWait, so both methods agree now. Because earlier, when I did the integral approach incorrectly, I got a different result, but after correcting the substitution, I get back to the same expression, which is p - q.\n\nTherefore, my initial approach was correct, and the integral approach, after correction, also leads to S = p - q.\n\nTherefore, the double sum S is equal to p - q.\n\nThus, the answer is p - q, which can be written as \\boxed{p - q}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{p - q}\n</think>\n\nFirst, we define the sums \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) as follows:\n\\[ p = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad q = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^3}. \\]\n\nWe need to express the double sum\n\\[ S = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3} \\]\nin terms of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\).\n\nWe start by changing the variable \\( n = j + k \\). For each \\( n \\geq 2 \\), the number of pairs \\((j, k)\\) such that \\( j + k = n \\) is \\( n - 1 \\). Therefore, we can rewrite the double sum as:\n\\[ S = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{n^3}. \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ S = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{n - 1}{n^3}. \\]\n\nWe can split the term inside the sum:\n\\[ \\frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3}. \\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\\[ S = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3} \\right). \\]\n\nThis can be separated into two sums:\n\\[ S = \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}. \\]\n\nRecognizing these sums in terms of \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), we know:\n\\[ \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} = p - 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} = q - 1. \\]\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\\[ S = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - q. \\]\n\nThus, the double sum is expressed as:\n\\[ \\boxed{p - q}. \\]", "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>If $f(x) = \\frac{3x-2}{x-2}$, what is the value of $f(-2) +f(-1)+f(0)$?

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step because I don't want to make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, I know that to find \\( f(-2) \\), I just substitute \\( x = -2 \\) into the function. Similarly, I'll do the same for \\( f(-1) \\) and \\( f(0) \\). Then, I'll add all those results together. That seems straightforward, but let me make sure I do each substitution correctly.\n\nStarting with \\( f(-2) \\):\nThe function is \\( \\frac{3x - 2}{x - 2} \\). So, replacing \\( x \\) with \\( -2 \\), we get:\n\\( f(-2) = \\frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} \\). Let me compute the numerator and denominator separately.\n\nNumerator: \\( 3(-2) \\) is \\( -6 \\), then subtract 2, so that's \\( -6 - 2 = -8 \\).\nDenominator: \\( -2 - 2 \\) is \\( -4 \\).\nSo, \\( f(-2) = \\frac{-8}{-4} \\). Dividing two negatives gives a positive, so \\( \\frac{8}{4} = 2 \\). Got that, \\( f(-2) = 2 \\).\n\nNext, \\( f(-1) \\):\nAgain, substituting \\( x = -1 \\) into the function:\n\\( f(-1) = \\frac{3(-1) - 2}{-1 - 2} \\).\n\nNumerator: \\( 3(-1) = -3 \\), subtract 2, so \\( -3 - 2 = -5 \\).\nDenominator: \\( -1 - 2 = -3 \\).\nTherefore, \\( f(-1) = \\frac{-5}{-3} \\). Again, two negatives make a positive, so \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\). So, \\( f(-1) = \\frac{5}{3} \\).\n\nNow, \\( f(0) \\):\nSubstituting \\( x = 0 \\):\n\\( f(0) = \\frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} \\).\n\nNumerator: \\( 3(0) = 0 \\), subtract 2, so \\( 0 - 2 = -2 \\).\nDenominator: \\( 0 - 2 = -2 \\).\nThus, \\( f(0) = \\frac{-2}{-2} = 1 \\). That's straightforward, \\( f(0) = 1 \\).\n\nAlright, so now I have all three values:\n\\( f(-2) = 2 \\),\n\\( f(-1) = \\frac{5}{3} \\),\n\\( f(0) = 1 \\).\n\nNow, I need to add them together: \\( 2 + \\frac{5}{3} + 1 \\).\n\nLet me convert all these to fractions with a common denominator to add them easily. The denominators here are 1, 3, and 1. So, the least common denominator is 3.\n\nConverting each term:\n- \\( 2 = \\frac{6}{3} \\)\n- \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\) stays the same.\n- \\( 1 = \\frac{3}{3} \\)\n\nNow, adding them up:\n\\( \\frac{6}{3} + \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{6 + 5 + 3}{3} = \\frac{14}{3} \\).\n\nWait, hold on, let me check that addition again. 6 + 5 is 11, and 11 + 3 is 14. So, yes, \\( \\frac{14}{3} \\) is correct.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in my calculations earlier, let me verify each substitution step.\n\nFor \\( f(-2) \\):\n\\( 3(-2) = -6 \\), minus 2 is -8. Denominator: \\( -2 - 2 = -4 \\). So, \\( -8 / -4 = 2 \\). Correct.\n\nFor \\( f(-1) \\):\n\\( 3(-1) = -3 \\), minus 2 is -5. Denominator: \\( -1 - 2 = -3 \\). So, \\( -5 / -3 = 5/3 \\). Correct.\n\nFor \\( f(0) \\):\n\\( 3(0) = 0 \\), minus 2 is -2. Denominator: \\( 0 - 2 = -2 \\). So, \\( -2 / -2 = 1 \\). Correct.\n\nAdding them again: 2 + 5/3 + 1. 2 + 1 is 3, so 3 + 5/3. 3 is 9/3, so 9/3 + 5/3 is 14/3. Yes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, 14/3 is an improper fraction, but the question asks for a common fraction, which 14/3 is. So, I think that's the final answer.\n\nJust to recap:\n- Calculated each function value by substitution.\n- Converted all to thirds to add them.\n- Verified each step to make sure no arithmetic errors.\n\nI don't see any mistakes in my process, so I feel confident that the answer is 14/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) where the function is given by \\( f(x) = \\frac{3x - 2}{x - 2} \\), we start by substituting each value into the function.\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( f(-2) \\):\n\\[\nf(-2) = \\frac{3(-2) - 2}{-2 - 2} = \\frac{-6 - 2}{-4} = \\frac{-8}{-4} = 2\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate \\( f(-1) \\):\n\\[\nf(-1) = \\frac{3(-1) - 2}{-1 - 2} = \\frac{-3 - 2}{-3} = \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3}\n\\]\n\nThen, we calculate \\( f(0) \\):\n\\[\nf(0) = \\frac{3(0) - 2}{0 - 2} = \\frac{0 - 2}{-2} = \\frac{-2}{-2} = 1\n\\]\n\nNow, we add these values together:\n\\[\nf(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) = 2 + \\frac{5}{3} + 1\n\\]\n\nConverting each term to a fraction with a common denominator of 3:\n\\[\n2 = \\frac{6}{3}, \\quad \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{5}{3}, \\quad 1 = \\frac{3}{3}\n\\]\n\nAdding these fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{3} + \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{6 + 5 + 3}{3} = \\frac{14}{3}\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}.", "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nAlright, so I need to figure out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has. Hmm, divisors, okay, that means numbers that can divide 196 without leaving a remainder. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nI remember from math class that to find the number of divisors of a number, you first need to find its prime factorization. Once you have that, there's some formula involving adding one to each of the exponents and then multiplying them together. Let me see if I can recall that correctly.\n\nSo, prime factorization of 196. I know that 196 is an even number because it ends with a 6, so it's divisible by 2. Let me divide it by 2:\n\n196 \u00f7 2 = 98.\n\nAlright, 98 is still even, so I can divide by 2 again:\n\n98 \u00f7 2 = 49.\n\nOkay, now I have 49, which I know is a square number. 49 is 7 times 7. So, 49 \u00f7 7 = 7, and then 7 \u00f7 7 = 1.\n\nSo putting it all together, the prime factors of 196 are 2, 2, 7, and 7. In exponent form, that's 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2.\n\nNow, the formula for the number of divisors is to take each of the exponents, add one to them, and then multiply those together. So, for 2\u00b2, the exponent is 2, and for 7\u00b2, the exponent is also 2.\n\nSo, adding one to each exponent: 2 + 1 = 3, and 2 + 1 = 3. Then, multiply those together: 3 \u00d7 3 = 9.\n\nWait, does that mean 196 has 9 positive divisors? Let me list them out to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting from 1 and going up, the divisors of 196 should be:\n\n1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196.\n\nLet me count them: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Yep, that's 9 divisors.\n\nHmm, so it seems like the formula worked. I wonder why that is. I think it's because when you express a number as a product of primes raised to exponents, each divisor can be formed by choosing how many of each prime factor to include, ranging from 0 up to the exponent. So for 2\u00b2, you can have 2\u2070, 2\u00b9, or 2\u00b2. Similarly for 7\u00b2, you can have 7\u2070, 7\u00b9, or 7\u00b2. Multiplying these choices together gives all possible combinations, which are the divisors.\n\nLet me test this with a smaller number to see if I understand. Let's take 6, which factors into 2\u00b9 \u00d7 3\u00b9. Using the formula, it should have (1+1)(1+1) = 4 divisors. And indeed, 1, 2, 3, 6 are the divisors. That makes sense.\n\nSo, applying the same logic to 196, which is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2, gives us (2+1)(2+1) = 9 divisors. Listing them out confirmed that, so I feel confident that the answer is 9.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. I started by factoring 196 completely into primes, double-checked the formula, applied it, and then listed out the divisors to verify. Everything lines up. So, yeah, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, we start by finding its prime factorization. \n\n196 is even, so we divide by 2:\n\\[ 196 \\div 2 = 98 \\]\n98 is also even, so we divide by 2 again:\n\\[ 98 \\div 2 = 49 \\]\n49 is a square number, so we divide by 7:\n\\[ 49 \\div 7 = 7 \\]\nFinally, dividing 7 by 7 gives:\n\\[ 7 \\div 7 = 1 \\]\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n\\[ 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\]\n\nTo find the number of divisors, we use the formula which involves adding one to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiplying the results:\n\\[ (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\nListing the divisors confirms this: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. There are 9 divisors in total.\n\nThe number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}."]
