["Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>Convert the point $(0,3)$ in rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.  Enter your answer in the form $(r,\\theta),$ where $r > 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta < 2 \\pi.$<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to convert the rectangular coordinates (0, 3) to polar coordinates. Hmm, I remember that polar coordinates are represented as (r, \u03b8), where r is the distance from the origin and \u03b8 is the angle made with the positive x-axis. \n\nFirst, let me recall the formulas to convert from rectangular (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, \u03b8). I think the formula for r is the square root of (x squared plus y squared). Yeah, that sounds right. So, r = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). \n\nThen, for \u03b8, I believe it's the arctangent of y over x. But wait, I should be careful because depending on the quadrant where the point is, the angle might need to be adjusted. Since our point is (0, 3), it's on the y-axis, specifically the positive y-axis. \n\nLet me write down the given point: x = 0, y = 3. \n\nStarting with r, plugging into the formula: r = sqrt(0\u00b2 + 3\u00b2) = sqrt(0 + 9) = sqrt(9) = 3. So, r is 3. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, onto \u03b8. Since x is 0 and y is positive, the point is on the positive y-axis. In polar coordinates, that corresponds to an angle of \u03c0/2 radians, which is 90 degrees. Wait, let me verify that. The arctangent of y/x when x is 0 is undefined, but since y is positive, it's pointing straight up along the y-axis, so \u03b8 should be \u03c0/2. \n\nAlternatively, if I try to compute \u03b8 using the arctangent formula, \u03b8 = arctan(y/x). But since x is 0, this becomes arctan(3/0), which is arctan(infinity). I remember that arctan(infinity) is \u03c0/2. So, that confirms it. \n\nTherefore, \u03b8 is \u03c0/2. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the polar coordinates are (3, \u03c0/2). \n\nWait, let me just double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I convert (3, \u03c0/2) back to rectangular coordinates, I should get (0, 3). Using the conversion formulas: x = r*cos\u03b8, y = r*sin\u03b8. \n\nCalculating x: 3*cos(\u03c0/2). Cos(\u03c0/2) is 0, so x = 0. \n\nCalculating y: 3*sin(\u03c0/2). Sin(\u03c0/2) is 1, so y = 3*1 = 3. \n\nYep, that gives us back the original point (0, 3). So, that seems correct. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that when x is 0 and y is positive, the angle is \u03c0/2. If x was 0 and y was negative, it would be 3\u03c0/2, but in this case, y is positive, so it's \u03c0/2. \n\nJust to recap: \n\n1. Calculate r using the distance formula: r = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 3.\n2. Determine \u03b8 based on the position of the point. Since it's on the positive y-axis, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2.\n3. Confirm by converting back to rectangular coordinates to ensure it matches the original point.\n\nEverything checks out. I think I'm confident with this answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe polar coordinates are \\boxed{(3, \\frac{\\pi}{2})}.\n</think>\n\nTo convert the rectangular coordinates \\((0, 3)\\) to polar coordinates, we use the formulas for \\(r\\) and \\(\\theta\\).\n\n1.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \\(p\\) is the well-known Basel problem, which sums to \\(\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\), and \\(q\\) is the Riemann zeta function at 3, which doesn't have a simple expression but is known numerically. But the question is about expressing the double sum in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), so I need to manipulate the double sum to relate it to these known series.\n\nLet me write down the double sum again:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\n\\]\n\nI need to find a way to express this in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\). Maybe I can change variables to simplify this expression. Let's consider substituting \\(n = j + k\\). Then, for each fixed \\(n\\), \\(j\\) can range from 1 to \\(n - 1\\), and \\(k = n - j\\). So, the double sum can be rewritten as a single sum over \\(n\\) from 2 to infinity, with each term being the sum over \\(j\\) from 1 to \\(n - 1\\) of \\(\\frac{1}{n^3}\\).\n\nLet me try writing that out:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\sum_{j = 1}^{n - 1} \\frac{1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nSince the inner sum is just adding \\(\\frac{1}{n^3}\\) a total of \\(n - 1\\) times, it simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nAlright, so that's progress. Now, let's write this as two separate sums:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3} \\right )\n\\]\n\nBecause \\(\\frac{n - 1}{n^3} = \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3}\\). That seems right. So, now I can split the sum into two parts:\n\n\\[\nS = \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3}\n\\]\n\nNow, these look similar to \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), which start the sums from \\(n = 1\\). So, if I adjust the indices, I can express these sums in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\nFor the first sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} = \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{1^2} = p - 1\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, for the second sum:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{n = 2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} = \\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^3} - \\frac{1}{1^3} = q - 1\n\\]\n\nTherefore, substituting back into \\(S\\):\n\n\\[\nS = (p - 1) - (q - 1) = p - 1 - q + 1 = p - q\n\\]\n\nWait, that simplifies nicely! So, \\(S = p - q\\). Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\n1. I changed variables from \\(j, k\\) to \\(n = j + k\\), which seems valid because each pair \\((j, k)\\) corresponds to a unique \\(n\\) with \\(j\\) and \\(k\\) positive integers.\n2. Then, for each \\(n\\), I summed over \\(j\\) from 1 to \\(n - 1\\), which gives \\(n - 1\\) terms, each contributing \\(\\frac{1}{n^3}\\), so the inner sum is \\(\\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\\).\n3. I split \\(\\frac{n - 1}{n^3}\\) into \\(\\frac{1}{n^2} - \\frac{1}{n^3}\\), which is algebraically correct.\n4. Then, I expressed each resulting sum in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) by subtracting the \\(n=1\\) term, which is 1 for both sums. That gives me \\(p - 1\\) and \\(q - 1\\).\n5. Subtracting these, the \\(-1\\) and \\(+1\\) cancel out, leaving \\(p - q\\).\n\nEverything seems to check out. So, the double sum is equal to \\(p - q\\). Therefore, the answer should be \\(p - q\\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe double sum is equal to \\(\\boxed{p - q}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo express the double sum \\(\\sum_{j = 1}^\\infty \\sum_{k = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{(j + k)^3}\\) in terms of \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), we start by changing variables.

Express your answer as a common fraction.<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I have this function f(x) which is equal to (3x - 2) divided by (x - 2). And I need to find the value of f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0). Hmm, sounds straightforward, but let me take it step by step to make sure I don't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, let me write down the function again to have it clear: f(x) = (3x - 2)/(x - 2). So, for each value of x, I plug it into this function and compute the result. Then, I'll add them all together.\n\nStarting with f(-2). That means I replace every x in the function with -2. So, let's compute the numerator and denominator separately to avoid confusion.\n\nNumerator: 3*(-2) - 2. Let me calculate that. 3 times -2 is -6. Then, subtract 2 from that. So, -6 - 2 is -8. Got that.\n\nDenominator: (-2) - 2. That's straightforward. -2 minus 2 is -4.\n\nSo, f(-2) is numerator over denominator, which is (-8)/(-4). Hmm, negative divided by negative is positive, so that's 8/4, which simplifies to 2. Okay, so f(-2) is 2. That seems simple enough.\n\nNext, let's compute f(-1). Again, I'll substitute x with -1 in the function.\n\nNumerator: 3*(-1) - 2. 3 times -1 is -3. Then, subtract 2, so -3 - 2 is -5.\n\nDenominator: (-1) - 2. That's -1 minus 2, which is -3.\n\nSo, f(-1) is (-5)/(-3). Again, negative over negative is positive, so that's 5/3. Hmm, 5/3 is approximately 1.666..., but I'll keep it as a fraction for accuracy.\n\nNow, onto f(0). Substitute x with 0.\n\nNumerator: 3*(0) - 2. That's 0 - 2, which is -2.\n\nDenominator: 0 - 2. That's just -2.\n\nSo, f(0) is (-2)/(-2). Negative divided by negative is positive, so that's 1. Simple enough.\n\nAlright, so now I have f(-2) = 2, f(-1) = 5/3, and f(0) = 1. Now, I need to add these three values together.\n\nLet me write that out: 2 + 5/3 + 1. To add these, it might be easier to convert all the numbers to fractions with a common denominator.\n\nFirst, 2 can be written as 6/3, because 6 divided by 3 is 2. Similarly, 1 can be written as 3/3, since 3 divided by 3 is 1. So, rewriting each term:\n\n2 = 6/3\n\n5/3 stays the same.\n\n1 = 3/3\n\nSo now, adding them together: 6/3 + 5/3 + 3/3.\n\nSince all the denominators are the same, I can just add the numerators:\n\n6 + 5 + 3 = 14\n\nSo, 14/3 is the sum.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me double-check that addition. 6 + 5 is 11, and 11 + 3 is 14. Yeah, that's correct. So, 14/3 is the total.\n\nHmm, 14/3 is an improper fraction, but the problem asks to express it as a common fraction, so that should be fine. Alternatively, it could also be written as a mixed number, but since they specify a common fraction, 14/3 is acceptable.\n\nJust to recap, I found each function value by plugging in the x-values into f(x), calculated each numerator and denominator separately, simplified each fraction, then added them all together by converting to like denominators. That seems solid.\n\nLet me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a calculation error.\n\nFirst, f(-2):\n\nNumerator: 3*(-2) - 2 = -6 - 2 = -8. Correct.\n\nDenominator: (-2) - 2 = -4. Correct.\n\nf(-2) = (-8)/(-4) = 2. Correct.\n\nNext, f(-1):\n\nNumerator: 3*(-1) - 2 = -3 - 2 = -5. Correct.\n\nDenominator: (-1) - 2 = -3. Correct.\n\nf(-1) = (-5)/(-3) = 5/3. Correct.\n\nThen, f(0):\n\nNumerator: 3*0 - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2. Correct.\n\nDenominator: 0 - 2 = -2. Correct.\n\nf(0) = (-2)/(-2) = 1. Correct.\n\nAdding them up: 2 + 5/3 + 1.\n\nConvert to fractions with denominator 3: 6/3 + 5/3 + 3/3 = (6 + 5 + 3)/3 = 14/3. Correct.\n\nSo, all steps check out. I don't think I made any errors here.\n\nJust to think, sometimes when dealing with fractions, especially negatives, it's easy to slip up, but in this case, everything worked out. It's crucial to remember that a negative divided by a negative is positive, so I didn't have to worry about the signs affecting the final results.\n\nAnother thing to note is that each substitution was straightforward because the function is a simple rational function, so no complicated steps were involved. Just plug and play.\n\nSo, putting it all together, f(-2) is 2, f(-1) is 5/3, f(0) is 1. Adding them up gives 14/3. So, the final answer is 14/3.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me add them another way to ensure consistency.\n\nInstead of converting to thirds, let me add 2 and 1 first, which is 3, then add 5/3.\n\nSo, 3 + 5/3. 3 can be written as 9/3, so 9/3 + 5/3 is 14/3. Yep, same result.\n\nAlternatively, if I convert all to decimal just to see:\n\n2 is 2.0, 5/3 is approximately 1.666..., and 1 is 1.0. Adding them: 2.0 + 1.666... + 1.0 = 4.666..., which is 14/3 because 14 divided by 3 is approximately 4.666...\n\nSo, that also checks out.\n\nAlright, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that the answer is 14/3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}.\n</think>\n\nTo find the value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) for the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{3x - 2}{x - 2} \\), we start by evaluating the function at each specified point.\n\nFirst, we evaluate \\( f(-2) \\):\n- Numerator: \\( 3(-2) - 2 = -6 - 2 = -8 \\)\n- Denominator: \\( -2 - 2 = -4 \\)\n- Therefore, \\( f(-2) = \\frac{-8}{-4} = 2 \\)\n\nNext, we evaluate \\( f(-1) \\):\n- Numerator: \\( 3(-1) - 2 = -3 - 2 = -5 \\)\n- Denominator: \\( -1 - 2 = -3 \\)\n- Therefore, \\( f(-1) = \\frac{-5}{-3} = \\frac{5}{3} \\)\n\nThen, we evaluate \\( f(0) \\):\n- Numerator: \\( 3(0) - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2 \\)\n- Denominator: \\( 0 - 2 = -2 \\)\n- Therefore, \\( f(0) = \\frac{-2}{-2} = 1 \\)\n\nNow, we add the results together:\n- Convert each term to a fraction with a common denominator: \\( 2 = \\frac{6}{3} \\), \\( 1 = \\frac{3}{3} \\)\n- Adding these fractions: \\( \\frac{6}{3} + \\frac{5}{3} + \\frac{3}{3} = \\frac{6 + 5 + 3}{3} = \\frac{14}{3} \\)\n\nThus, the value of \\( f(-2) + f(-1) + f(0) \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{14}{3}}.", "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<\uff5cUser\uff5c>How many positive whole-number divisors does 196 have?<\uff5cAssistant\uff5c><think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has. Hmm, divisors, right? Those are numbers that divide 196 without leaving a remainder. I remember from math class that to find the number of divisors, I need to look at the prime factorization of the number first. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFirst, prime factorization is breaking down a number into the product of its prime number components. So, for 196, I need to divide it by primes until I'm left with 1. Let me start with the smallest prime, which is 2.\n\n196 divided by 2 is 98. Okay, that's straightforward. Now, 98 can still be divided by 2, right? 98 divided by 2 is 49. So, so far, I have 2 times 2 times 49. Now, 49 isn't divisible by 2, so I move to the next prime number, which is 3. But 49 divided by 3 is not a whole number\u2014it's about 16.333... So, 3 doesn't work.\n\nNext prime is 5. 49 divided by 5 is 9.8, which isn't a whole number either. Hmm, moving on. The next prime is 7. Ah, 49 divided by 7 is 7. Perfect! So now, I have 2 times 2 times 7 times 7. \n\nWait, let me write that down properly. 196 can be expressed as 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2. Yeah, that looks right because 2 squared is 4, and 7 squared is 49, and 4 times 49 is 196. So, the prime factorization is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 7\u00b2.\n\nNow, I remember that the formula for finding the number of divisors is to take the exponents of the prime factors, add one to each of them, and then multiply those together. Let me make sure I got that right. So, for each prime factor, take its exponent, add one, and then multiply all these together. Yeah, that seems familiar.\n\nIn this case, the exponents are 2 and 2 for primes 2 and 7, respectively. So, adding one to each exponent gives me 3 and 3. Then, multiplying those together: 3 \u00d7 3 equals 9. So, does that mean 196 has 9 positive divisors?\n\nWait a second, let me test that. Maybe I should list all the divisors to be sure. If 196 has 9 divisors, let me see if I can list them.\n\nStarting from 1, obviously 1 is a divisor. Then 2, since it's even. 4, because it's divisible by 2 twice. Then 7, since 7 is a prime factor. 14, which is 2\u00d77. 28, which is 4\u00d77 or 2\u00b2\u00d77. 49, which is 7\u00b2. 98, which is 2\u00d749 or 2\u00d77\u00b2. And finally, 196 itself. Let me count these: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. That's 9 divisors. Okay, so that matches up with the calculation.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't miss any, let me think. After 98, the next number would be 196, which I already included. Before 1, there are no positive divisors less than 1, so that's all. So, yes, 9 seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think about it another way. Since 196 is a square number, its square root is 14, which is an integer. I remember that for square numbers, the number of divisors is odd because one of the pairs is repeated. So, in this case, the square root is 14, which means that when I list the divisors in pairs, one of the pairs will be (14,14). So, that's why the total number is odd.\n\nBut how does that relate to the number of divisors? Well, if I pair the divisors, each pair multiplies to 196. So, 1 pairs with 196, 2 pairs with 98, 4 pairs with 49, 7 pairs with 28, and 14 pairs with 14. So, that's 5 pairs, but since 14 is repeated, the total number is 9. Wait, hold on, 5 pairs would be 10 numbers, but since 14 is only counted once, it's 9. So, that's another way to see it.\n\nBut maybe that's complicating things. The formula seems straightforward. Prime factorization, add one to each exponent, multiply them together. So, for 196, which is 2\u00b2\u00d77\u00b2, that gives (2+1)(2+1)=9. So, that's consistent.\n\nI think I've got it. So, 196 has 9 positive whole-number divisors. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't miss anything. I started by factoring 196 into primes, got 2\u00b2\u00d77\u00b2, applied the formula, and confirmed by listing all the divisors. Both methods led me to 9. So, I feel confident that the answer is 9.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\boxed{9}.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many positive whole-number divisors 196 has, we start with its prime factorization. \n\n196 can be divided by 2:\n\\[ 196 \\div 2 = 98 \\]\n\\[ 98 \\div 2 = 49 \\]\n\nNext, 49 can be divided by 7:\n\\[ 49 \\div 7 = 7 \\]\n\\[ 7 \\div 7 = 1 \\]\n\nThus, the prime factorization of 196 is:\n\\[ 196 = 2^2 \\times 7^2 \\]\n\nTo find the number of divisors, we use the formula which involves taking the exponents of the prime factors, adding one to each, and then multiplying the results:\n\\[ (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \\times 3 = 9 \\]\n\nWe can verify this by listing all the divisors: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, 49, 98, 196. There are 9 divisors in total.\n\nThus, the number of positive whole-number divisors of 196 is \\(\\boxed{9}\\)."]
