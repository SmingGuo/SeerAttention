# SeerAttention

SeerAttention is a learning-based method to enable block-level sparse attention for long-context LLM without using prefined static pattern or heuristic methods. It can be applied in Post-training or Fine-tuning stages. The Attention Gate units learn from the intrinsic sparse attention maps generated by your original pre-trained models.

## Environment
```bash
    conda create -yn seer python=3.11
    conda activate seer
    pip install torch==2.4.0
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Download the pretrained models for experiments
```bash
    mkdir models
    huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B --local-dir  models/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B
    huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B --local-dir  models/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B
    huggingface-cli download meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --local-dir  models/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct


```


## Post-training with SeerAttention
Only AttnGates are trained in this stages. Run the below script to reproduce the results on llama-3-8B. Once you obtain the model, different sparsity ratios can be applied.
```bash
    bash scripts/run_post_training.sh
```


## Fine-tuning with SeerAttention
Fine-tuning a model in long-context extension with SeerAttention with a fixed sparsity. The current fine-tuning implementation relies on using the backward path of torch sqda kernel, which is slow. Further optimization of our customized training kernel with be developed. 
```bash
    bash scripts/run_seerattn_yarn_finetuning.sh
```

## Experiment with other AttnGate designs
The current AttnGate design is very simple, only a pooling plus linear layer. You can test your own design by using our attention pooling kernels. It is a functional self-attention kernel but also outputs the 2D maxpooled attention map (block-size 64).
```python
    attn_output, pooling_gt = attn_with_pooling(
        query_states,
        key_states,
        value_states,
        True, 
        1.0 / math.sqrt(self.head_dim)      
    )        
```
